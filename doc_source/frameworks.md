# Use Machine Learning Frameworks, Python, and R with Amazon SageMaker<a name="frameworks"></a>

You can use Python and R natively in Amazon SageMaker notebook kernels\. There are also kernels that support specific frameworks\. A very popular way to get started with SageMaker is to use the [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io)\. It provides open source Python APIs and containers that make it easy to train and deploy models in SageMaker, as well as examples for use with several different machine learning and deep learning frameworks\.

For information about using specific frameworks or how to use R in SageMaker, see the following topics\.
