# Use Chainer with Amazon SageMaker<a name="chainer"></a>

You can use SageMaker to train and deploy a model using custom Chainer code\. The SageMaker Python SDK Chainer estimators and models and the SageMaker open\-source Chainer container make writing a Chainer script and running it in SageMaker easier\.

## What do you want to do?<a name="chainer-intent"></a>

I want to train a custom Chainer model in SageMaker\.  
For a sample Jupyter notebook, see the [Chainer example notebooks](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/mxnet_mnist) in the Amazon SageMaker Examples GitHub repository\.  
For documentation, see [Train a Model with Chainer](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_chainer.html#train-a-model-with-chainer)\.

I have a Chainer model that I trained in SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a hosted endpoint\.  
For more information, see [Deploy Chainer models](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_chainer.html#deploy-chainer-models)\.

I have a Chainer model that I trained outside of SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a SageMaker endpoint  
For more information, see [Deploy Endpoints from Model Data](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_chainer.html#deploy-endpoints-from-model-data)\.

I want to see the API documentation for [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io) Chainer classes\.  
For more information, see [Chainer Classes](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sagemaker.chainer.html)\.

I want to find information about SageMaker Chainer containers\.  
For more information, see the [SageMaker Chainer Container GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-chainer-container)\.

 For information about supported Chainer versions, and for general information about writing Chainer training scripts and using Chainer estimators and models with SageMaker, see [Using Chainer with the SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_chainer.html)\.
