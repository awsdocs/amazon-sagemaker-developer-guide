# Create Amazon SNS Input and Output Topics<a name="sms-create-sns-input-topic"></a>

You need to create Amazon SNS input and output topics to create a streaming labeling job\. Once you create the topics, note down the topic Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of each topic\. These ARNs will be the input values for the parameter `SnsTopicArn` in `InputConfig` and `OutputConfig` when you create a labeling job\. 

## Create an Input Topic<a name="sms-streaming-input-topic"></a>

Your input topic is used to send new data objects to Ground Truth\. To create an input topic, follow the instructions in [To Create a Topic Using the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-tutorial-create-topic.html#create-topic-aws-console) in the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide\.

Note down your input topic ARN and use it as input for the `CreateLabelingJob` parameter `SnsTopicArn` in `InputConfig`\. 

## Create an Output Topic<a name="sms-streaming-output-topic"></a>

Your output topic is used to send notifications when a data object is labeled\. When you create a topic, you have the option to add an encryption key\. Use this option to add a AWS Key Management Service customer managed key \(CMK\) to your topic to encrypt the output data of your labeling job before it is published to your output topic\.

To create an output topic, follow the instructions in [To Create a Topic Using the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-tutorial-create-topic.html#create-topic-aws-console) in the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide\.

In step 4, to add encryption, follow the instructions [Add Encryption to Your Output Topic \(Optional\)](#sms-streaming-encryption)\.

**Important**  
To add a CMK to your output topic while creating a topic in the console, do not use the **\(Default\) alias/aws/sns** option\. Select a CMK key that you created\. 

Note down your input topic ARN and use it in your `CreateLabelingJob` request in the parameter `SnsTopicArn` in `OutputConfig`\. 

### Add Encryption to Your Output Topic \(Optional\)<a name="sms-streaming-encryption"></a>

To encrypt messages published to your output topic, you need to provide an AWS KMS customer managed key \(CMK\) to your topic\. Modify the following policy and add it to your CMK to give Ground Truth permission to encrypt output data before publishing it to your output topic\.

Replace *`<account_id>`* with the ID of the account that you are using to create your topic\. To learn how to find your AWS account ID, see [Finding Your AWS Account ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html#FindingYourAWSId)\. 

```
{
    "Id": "key-console-policy",
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<account_id>:root"
            },
            "Action": "kms:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Allow access for Key Administrators",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<account_id>:role/Admin"
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:Create*",
                "kms:Describe*",
                "kms:Enable*",
                "kms:List*",
                "kms:Put*",
                "kms:Update*",
                "kms:Revoke*",
                "kms:Disable*",
                "kms:Get*",
                "kms:Delete*",
                "kms:TagResource",
                "kms:UntagResource",
                "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion",
                "kms:CancelKeyDeletion"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Additionally, you must modify and add the following policy to the execution role that you use to create your labeling job \(the input value for `RoleArn`\)\. 

Replace *`<account_id>`* with the ID of the account that you are using to create your topic\. Replace *`<region>`* with the AWS Region you are using to create your labeling job\. Replace `<key_id>` with your CMK ID\.

```
{ 
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "sid1",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<account_id>:key/<key_id>"
    }
  ]
}
```

For more information on creating and securing keys, see [Creating Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) and [Using Key Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide\.

## Subscribe an Endpoint to Your Amazon SNS Output Topic<a name="sms-streaming-subscribe-output-topic"></a>

When a worker completes a labeling job task from a Ground Truth streaming labeling job, Ground Truth uses your output topic to publish output data to one or more endpoints that you specify\. To receive notifications when a worker finishes a labeling task, you must subscribe an endpoint to your Amazon SNS output topic\.

To learn how to add endpoints to your output topic, see [Tutorial: Subscribing an Endpoint to an Amazon SNS Topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-tutorial-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*\.

To learn more about the output data format that is published to these endpoints, see [Output Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-data-output.html)\. 

**Important**  
If you do not subscribe an endpoint to your Amazon SNS output topic, you will not receive notifications when new data objects are labeled\.
