When you create a video frame labeling job, you need to let Ground Truth know where to look for your input data\. You can do this in one of two ways:
+ You can store your input data in Amazon S3 and have Ground Truth automatically detect the input dataset used for your labeling job\. See [Automated Video Frame Input Data Setup](sms-video-automated-data-setup.md) to learn more about this option\. 
+ You can create an input manifest file and sequence files and upload them to Amazon S3\. See [Manual Input Data Setup](sms-video-manual-data-setup.md) to learn more about this option\.
