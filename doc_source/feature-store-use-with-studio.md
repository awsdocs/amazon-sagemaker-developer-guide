## Create a Feature Group in Studio<a name="feature-store-create-feature-group-studio"></a>

 The create feature group process in Studio has four steps: enter details, definitions, required features, and tags\. 

 Consider the following options before you start: 
+  If you plan to only use an online store, you just need the schema for your features\. This is your columns and each column’s data type\.  
+  If you plan to use an offline store, you need an S3 bucket URI and a Role ARN\.  
+  If you plan to use encryption, you need a KMS key\. You can use the same one for both the online store and your offline store, or have a unique key for each\. 
+  If you plan to use AWS Glue integration, be prepared to provide a data catalog name, database name, and table name\.
