# Step 7: Clean Up<a name="ex1-cleanup"></a>

To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, use the AWS Management Console to delete the endpoints and resources that you created while running the exercises\. 

**Note**  
Training jobs and logs cannot be deleted and are retained indefinitely\.

**Note**  
If you plan to explore other exercises in this guide, you might want to keep some of these resources, such as your notebook instance, S3 bucket, and IAM role\.

 

1. Open the Amazon SageMaker console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/sagemaker/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and delete the following resources:
   + The endpoint\. Deleting the endpoint also deletes the ML compute instance or instances that support it\.

     1. Under **Inference**, choose **Endpoints**\.

     1. Choose the endpoint that you created in the example, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Delete**\.
   + The endpoint configuration\.

     1. Under **Inference**, choose **Endpoint configurations**\.

     1. Choose the endpoint configuration that you created in the example, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Delete**\.
   + The model\.

     1. Under **Inference**, choose **Models**\.

     1. Choose the model that you created in the example, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Delete**\.
   + The notebook instance\. Before deleting the notebook instance, stop it\.

     1. Under **Notebook**, choose **Notebook instances**\.

     1. Choose the notebook instance that you created in the example, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Stop**\. The notebook instance takes several minutes to stop\. When the **Status** changes to **Stopped**, move on to the next step\.

     1. Choose **Actions**, and then choose **Delete**\.

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/), and then delete the bucket that you created for storing model artifacts and the training dataset\. 

1. Open the Amazon CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), and then delete all of the log groups that have names starting with `/aws/sagemaker/`\.
