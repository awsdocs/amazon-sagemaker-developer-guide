# Use IAM Managed Policies with Ground Truth<a name="sms-security-permissions-get-started"></a>

SageMaker and Ground Truth provide AWS managed policies that you can use to create a labeling job\. If you are getting started using Ground Truth and you do not require granular permissions for your use case, it is recommended that you use the following policies:
+ `[AmazonSageMakerFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerFullAccess)` – Use this policy to give a user or role permission to create a labeling job\. This is a broad policy that grants a entity permission to use SageMaker features, as well as features of necessary AWS services through the console and API\. This policy gives the entity permission to create a labeling job and to create and manage workforces using Amazon Cognito\. To learn more, see [AmazonSageMakerFullAccess Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security-iam-awsmanpol.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-AmazonSageMakerFullAccess)\.
+ `[AmazonSageMakerGroundTruthExecution](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerGroundTruthExecution)` – To create an *execution role*, you can attach the policy `[AmazonSageMakerGroundTruthExecution](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerGroundTruthExecution)` to a role\. An execution role is the role that you specify when you create a labeling job and it is used to start your labeling job\. This policy allows you to create both streaming and non\-streaming labeling jobs, and to create a labeling job using any task type\. Note the following limits of this managed policy\.
  + **Amazon S3 permissions**: This policy grants an execution role permission to access Amazon S3 buckets with the following strings in the name: `GroundTruth`, `Groundtruth`, `groundtruth`, `SageMaker`, `Sagemaker`, and `sagemaker` or a bucket with an [object tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-tagging.html) that includes `SageMaker` in the name \(case insensitive\)\. Make sure your input and output bucket names include these strings, or add additional permissions to your execution role to [grant it permission to access your Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_s3_rw-bucket.html)\. You must give this role permission to perform the following actions on your Amazon S3 buckets: `AbortMultipartUpload`, `GetObject`, and `PutObject`\.
  + **Custom Workflows**: When you create a [custom labeling workflow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-custom-templates.html), this execution role is restricted to invoking AWS Lambda functions with one of the following strings as part of the function name: `GtRecipe`, `SageMaker`, `Sagemaker`, `sagemaker`, or `LabelingFunction`\. This applies to both your pre\-annotation and post\-annotation Lambda functions\. If you choose to use names without those strings, you must explicitly provide `lambda:InvokeFunction` permission to the execution role used to create the labeling job\.

To learn how to attach an AWS managed policy to a user or role, refer to [Adding and removing IAM identity permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html#add-policies-console) in the IAM User Guide\.
