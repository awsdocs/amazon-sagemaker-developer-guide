# Deploy a Model Compiled with Neo \(AWS IoT Greengrass\)<a name="neo-deployment-greengrass"></a>

[AWS IoT Greengrass](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/what-is-gg.html) extends cloud capabilities to local devices\. It enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks\. With AWS IoT Greengrass, you can perform machine learning inference at the edge on locally generated data using cloud\-trained models\. Currently, you can deploy models on to all AWS IoT Greengrass devices based on ARM Cortex\-A, Intel Atom, and Nvidia Jetson series processors\. For more information on deploying a Lambda inference application to perform machine learning inferences with AWS IoT Greengrass, see [ Perform Machine Learning Inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/ml-inference.html)\.
