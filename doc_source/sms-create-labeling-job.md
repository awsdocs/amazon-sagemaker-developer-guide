# Create a Labeling Job<a name="sms-create-labeling-job"></a>

You can create a labeling job in the Amazon SageMaker console and by using an AWS SDK in your preferred language to run `CreateLabelingJob`\. After a labeling job has been created, you can track worker metrics \(for private workforces\) and your labeling job status using [CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-monitor-cloud-watch.html)\.

After you have chosen your task type, use the topics on this page to learn how to create a labeling job\. If you are a new Ground Truth user, we recommend that you start by walking through the demo in [Getting started](sms-getting-started.md)\.
