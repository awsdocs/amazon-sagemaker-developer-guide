# Download and Set Up Edge Manager Agent Manually<a name="edge-device-fleet-manual"></a>

Download the Edge Manager agent based on your operating system, architecture, and your AWS region\. The agent is periodically updated, so you have the option to choose your agent based on release dates and versions\. Once you have the agent, create a JSON configuration file\. Specify the device IoT thing name, fleet name, device credentials, and other key\-value pairs\. See [Running SageMaker Edge Manager agent](#edge-device-fleet-running-agent) for full a list of keys you need to specify in the configuration file\. You can run the agent as an executable binary or it can be linked against as a Dynamic Shared Object \. 

## How the Agent Works<a name="edge-device-fleet-how-agent-works"></a>

The agent runs on the CPU of your devices\. The agent will run inference on the framework and hardware of the target device you specified during the compilation job\. For example, if you compiled your model for the Jetson Nano, the agent will support the GPU in the provided [Deep Learning Runtime](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr) \(DLR\)\.

The agent is released in binary format for supported operating systems\. Check your operating system is supported and meets the minimum OS requirement in the following table:

------
#### [ Linux ]

**Version:** Ubuntu 18\.04

**Supported Binary Formats:** x86\-64 bit \(ELF binary\) and ARMv8 64 bit \(ELF binary\)

------
#### [ Windows ]

**Version:** Windows 10 version 1909

**Supported Binary Formats:** x86\-32 bit \(DLL\) and x86\-64 bit \(DLL\)

## Installing Edge Manager agent<a name="edge-device-fleet-installation"></a>

To use Edge Manager agent, you first need to obtain the release artifacts and a Root Certificate\. The release artifacts are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket in the `us-west-2` Region\. To download the artifacts, specify your operating system \(`<OS>`\) and the `VERSION`\.

Based on your operating system, replace `<OS>` with one of the following:


| Windows 32\-bit | Windows 64\-bit | Linux x86\-64 | Linux ARMv8 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| windows\-x86 | windows\-x64 | linux\-x64 | linux\-armv8 | 

The `VERSION` is broken into three components: `<MAJOR_VERSION>.<YYYY-MM-DD>-<SHA-7>`, where:
+ `MAJOR_VERSION`: The release version\. The release version is currently set to `1`\.
+ `<YYYY-MM-DD>`: The time stamp of the artifacts release\.
+ `SHA-7`: The repository commit ID from which the release is built\.

You need to provide the `MAJOR_VERSION` and the time stamp in`<YYYY-MM-DD>` format\. We suggest you use the latest artifact release time stamp\. Use the following to get the latest time stamp\.

Run the following in your command line to get the latest time stamp\. Replace `<OS>` with your operating system:

```
aws s3 ls s3://sagemaker-edge-release-store-us-west-2-<OS>/Releases/ | sort -r
```

For example, if you have a Windows 32\-bit OS, run:

```
aws s3 ls s3://sagemaker-edge-release-store-us-west-2-windows-x86/Releases/ | sort -r
```

This returns:

```
2020-12-01 23:33:36 0 

                    PRE 1.20201218.81f481f/
                    PRE 1.20201207.02d0e97/
```

The return output in this example shows two release artifacts\. The first release artifact file notes that the release version: has a major release version of `1`, a time stamp of `20201218` \(in <YYYY\-MM\-DD> format\), and a `81f481f` SHA\-7 commit ID\.

**Note**  
The above command assumes you have configured AWS Command Line Interface\. For more information, about how to configure the settings that the AWS CLI uses to interact with AWS, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)\.

Based on your operating system, use the following commands to install the artifacts:

------
#### [ Windows 32\-bit ]

```
aws s3 cp s3://sagemaker-edge-release-store-us-west-2-windows-x86/Releases/<VERSION>/<VERSION>.zip .
aws s3 cp s3://sagemaker-edge-release-store-us-west-2-windows-x86/Releases/<VERSION>/sha256_hex.shasum .
```

------
#### [ Windows 64\-bit ]

```
aws s3 cp s3://sagemaker-edge-release-store-us-west-2-windows-x64/Releases/<VERSION>/<VERSION>.zip .
aws s3 cp s3://sagemaker-edge-release-store-us-west-2-windows-x64/Releases/<VERSION>/sha256_hex.shasum .
```

------
#### [ Linux x86\-64 ]

```
aws s3 cp s3://sagemaker-edge-release-store-us-west-2-linux-x64/Releases/<VERSION>/<VERSION>.tgz .
aws s3 cp s3://sagemaker-edge-release-store-us-west-2-linux-x64/Releases/<VERSION>/sha256_hex.shasum .
```

------
#### [ Linux ARMv8 ]

```
aws s3 cp s3://sagemaker-edge-release-store-us-west-2-linux-armv8/Releases/<VERSION>/<VERSION>.tgz .
aws s3 cp s3://sagemaker-edge-release-store-us-west-2-linux-armv8/Releases/<VERSION>/sha256_hex.shasum .
```

------

You will also need to download a Root Certificate\. This certificate validates model artifacts signed by AWS before loading them onto your edge devices\.

Replace `<OS>` corresponding to your platform from the list of supported operation systems and replace `<REGION>` with your AWS region\.

```
aws s3 cp s3://sagemaker-edge-release-store-us-west-2-<OS>/Certificates/<REGION>/<REGION>.pem .
```

## Running SageMaker Edge Manager agent<a name="edge-device-fleet-running-agent"></a>

SageMaker Edge Manager agent can be run as a standalone process in the form of an Executable and Linkable Format \(ELF\) executable binary or can be linked against as a Dynamic Shared Object \(\.dll\)\. Running as a standalone executable binary is the preferred mode and is supported on Linux\. Running as a shared object \(\.dll\) is supported on Windows\.

On Linux, we recommend that you run the binary via a service that’s a part of your initialization \(init\) system\. If you want to run the binary directly, you can do so in a terminal as shown below\. If you have a modern OS, there are no other installations necessary prior to running the agent, since all the requirements are statically built into the executable\. This gives you flexibility to run the agent on the terminal, as a service, or within a container\.

To run the agent you will first need to create a JSON configuration file\. Specify the following key\-value pairs:
+ `deviceName` : The name of the device, this device name needs to be registered along with device fleet in the SageMaker Edge Manager console\.
+ `deviceFleetName`: The name of the fleet the device belongs to\.
+ `region`: AWS region\. 
+ `rootCertsPath`: Absolute folder path to root certificates\. 
+ `provider`: Use `"Aws"`\.
+ `awsCACertFile`: Absolute path to Amazon Root CA certificate \(AmazonRootCA1\.pem\)\.
+ `awsCertFile`: Absolute path to AWS IoT signing root certificate \(\*\.pem\.crt\)\.
+ `awsCertPKFile`: Absolute path to AWS IoT private key\. \(\*\.pem\.key\)\.
+ `awsIoTCredEndpoint`: AWS IoT credentials endpoint \(*identifier*\.iot\.*region*\.amazonaws\.com\)\. See, [Connecting devices to AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-connect-devices.html) for more information\.
+ `captureDataDestination`: The destination for uploading capture data\. Select either “Cloud” or “Disk”\.
+ `S3BucketName`: Name of Amazon S3 bucket \(not the Amazon S3 bucket URI\)\. Bucket must have ‘sagemaker’ string within its name\.
+ `folderPrefix`: The Amazon S3 folder name where you want captured data to upload\.
+ `captureDataBufferSize`: Capture data buffer size\. Integer value\.
+ `captureDataBatchSize`: Capture data batch size\. Integer value\.
+ `pushPeriodSeconds`: Capture data push period in seconds\.
+ `base64EmbedLimit`: Limit for uploading capture data in bytes\. Integer value\.
+ `logVerbose` \(Optional\): Set debug log\. Boolean\. Select either “True” or “False”\.

Your configuration file should look similar to the following \(with your specific values specified\):

```
{
    "sagemaker_edge_core_device_name": "device-name",
    "sagemaker_edge_core_device_fleet_name": "fleet-name",
    "sagemaker_edge_core_region": "region",
    "sagemaker_edge_core_root_certs_path": "<Absolute path to root certificates>",
    "sagemaker_edge_provider_provider": "Aws",
    "sagemaker_edge_provider_aws_ca_cert_file": "<Absolute path to Amazon Root CA certificate>/AmazonRootCA1.pem",
    "sagemaker_edge_provider_aws_cert_file": "<Absolute path to AWS IoT signing root certificate>/device.pem.crt",
    "sagemaker_edge_provider_aws_cert_pk_file": "<Absolute path to AWS IoT private key.>/private.pem.key",
    "sagemaker_edge_provider_aws_iot_cred_endpoint": "https://<AWS IoT Endpoint Address>",
    "sagemaker_edge_core_capture_data_destination": "Cloud",
    "sagemaker_edge_provider_s3_bucket_name": "sagemaker-bucket-name",
    "sagemaker_edge_core_folder_prefix": "Amazon S3 folder prefix",
    "sagemaker_edge_core_capture_data_buffer_size": 30,
    "sagemaker_edge_core_capture_data_batch_size": 10,
    "sagemaker_edge_core_capture_data_push_period_seconds": 4,
    "sagemaker_edge_core_capture_data_base64_embed_limit": 20,
    "sagemaker_edge_log_verbose": false
}
```

Included in the release artifact is a binary executable called sagemaker\_edge\_agent\_binary in the `/bin` directory\. To run the binary, use the `-a` flag to create a socket file descriptor \(\.sock\) in a directory of your choosing and specify the path of the agent JSON config file you created with the `-c` flag\.

```
./sagemaker_edge_agent_binary -a <ADDRESS_TO_SOCKET> -c <PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>
```

For example:

```
./sagemaker_edge_agent_binary -a /tmp/sagemaker_edge_agent_example.sock -c sagemaker_edge_config.json
```

In this example a socket file descriptor named `sagemaker_edge_agent_example.sock` is created in the `/tmp` directory and points to a configuration file that is in the same working directory as the agent called `sagemaker_edge_config.json`\.
