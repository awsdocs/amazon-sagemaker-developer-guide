# Label Data<a name="data-label"></a>

To train a machine learning model, you need a large, high\-quality, labeled dataset\. You can label your data using Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth\. Choose from one of the Ground Truth [built\-in task types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-task-types.html) or create your own [custom labeling workflow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-custom-templates.html)\. To improve the accuracy of your data labels and reduce the total cost of labeling your data, use Ground Truth enhanced data labeling features like [automated data labeling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-automated-labeling.html) and [annotation consolidation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-annotation-consolidation.html)\.
