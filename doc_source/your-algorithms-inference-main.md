# Use Your Own Inference Code<a name="your-algorithms-inference-main"></a>

You can use Amazon SageMaker to interact with Docker containers and run your own inference code in one of two ways:
+ To use your own inference code with a persistent endpoint to get one prediction at a time, use Amazon SageMaker hosting services\.
+ To use your own inference code to get predictions for an entire dataset, use Amazon SageMaker batch transform\.
