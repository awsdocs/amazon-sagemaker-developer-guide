# Create a Point Cloud Sequence Input Manifest<a name="sms-point-cloud-multi-frame-input-data"></a>

The manifest is a UTF\-8 encoded file in which each line is a complete and valid JSON object\. Each line is delimited by a standard line break, \\n or \\r\\n\. Because each line must be a valid JSON object, you can't have unescaped line break characters\. In the point cloud sequence input manifest file, each line in the manifest contains a sequence of point cloud frames\. The point cloud data for each frame in the sequence can either be stored in binary or ASCII format\. For more information, see [Accepted Raw 3D Data Formats](sms-point-cloud-raw-data-types.md)\. This is the manifest file formatting required for 3D point cloud object tracking\. Optionally, you can also provide point attribute and camera sensor fusion data for each point cloud frame\. When you create a sequence input manifest file, you must provide LiDAR and video camera sensor fusion data in a [world coordinate system](sms-point-cloud-sensor-fusion-details.md#sms-point-cloud-world-coordinate-system)\. 

The following example demonstrates the syntax used for an input manifest file when each line in the manifest is a sequence file\. Each line in your input manifest file must be in [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) format\.

```
{"source-ref": "s3://awsexamplebucket/example-folder/seq1.json"}
{"source-ref": "s3://awsexamplebucket/example-folder/seq2.json"}
```

The data for each sequence of point cloud frames needs to be stored in a JSON data object\. The following is an example of the format you use for a sequence file\. Information about each frame is included as a JSON object and is listed in the `frames` list\. This is an example of a sequence file with two point cloud frame files, `frame300.bin` and `frame303.bin`\. The *\.\.\.* is used to indicated where you should include information for additional frames\. Add a JSON object for each frame in the sequence\.

The following code block includes a JSON object for a single sequence file\. The JSON object has been expanded for readability\.

|  `unix-timestamp`  |  Yes  |  Number  |  The unix timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1st, 1970 until the UTC time that the data was collected by a sensor\.  The timestamp for each frame must be different and timestamps must be sequential because they are used for cuboid interpolation\. Ideally, this should be the real timestamp when the data was collected\. If this is not available, you must use an incremental sequence of timestamps, where the first frame in your sequence file corresponds to the first timestamp in the sequence\.  | 
|  `frame`  |  Yes  |  String **Example of format** `<folder-name>/<sequence-file.json>`  |  The relative location, in Amazon S3 of your sequence file\. This relative path will be appended to the path you specify in `prefix`\.  |

## Include Vehicle Pose Information in Your Input Manifest<a name="sms-point-cloud-multi-frame-ego-vehicle-input"></a>

Use the ego\-vehicle location to provide information about the pose of the vehicle used to capture point cloud data\. Ground Truth use this information to compute LiDAR extrinsic matrices\. 

Ground Truth uses extrinsic matrices to project labels to and from the 3D scene and 2D images\. For more information, see [Sensor Fusion](sms-point-cloud-sensor-fusion-details.md#sms-point-cloud-sensor-fusion)\.

The following table provides more information about the `position` and orientation \(`heading`\) parameters that are required when you provide ego\-vehicle information\. 


****  

|  Parameter  |  Required  |  Accepted Values  |  Description  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  `position`  |  Yes  |  JSON object **Required Parameters**: `x`, `y`, and `z`\. Enter numbers for these parameters\.   |  The translation vector of the ego vehicle in the world coordinate system\.   | 
|  `heading`  |  Yes  |  JSON Object **Required Parameters**: `qx`, `qy`, `qz`, and `qw`\. Enter numbers for these parameters\.   |  The orientation of the frame of reference of the device or sensor mounted on the vehicle sensing the surrounding, measured in [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion), \(`qx`, `qy`, `qz`, `qw`\) in the a coordinate system\.  | 

## Include Camera Data in Your Input Manifest<a name="sms-point-cloud-multi-frame-image-input"></a>

If you want to include color camera data with a frame, use the following parameters to provide information about each image\. The **Required** column in the following table applies when the `images` parameter is included in the input manifest file\. You are not required to include images in your input manifest file\. 

If you include camera images, you must include information about the `position` and orientation \(`heading`\) of the camera used the capture the images\. 

If your images are distorted, Ground Truth can automatically undistort them using information you provide about the image in your input manifest file, including distortion coefficients \(`k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `k4`, `p1`, `p1`\), camera model and focal length \(`fx`, `fy`\), and the principal point \(`cx`, `cy)`\. To learn more about these coefficients and undistorting images, see [Camera calibration With OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4.13.7/doc/tutorials/calib3d/camera_calibration/camera_calibration.html)\. If distortion coefficients are not included, Ground Truth will not undistort an image\.
