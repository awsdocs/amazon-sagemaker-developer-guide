# Create a Baseline<a name="model-monitor-create-baseline"></a>

The baseline calculations of statistics and constraints are needed as a standard against which data drift and other data quality issues can be detected\. Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor provides a built\-in container that provides the ability to suggest the constraints automatically for CSV and flat JSON input\. This *sagemaker\-model\-monitor\-analyzer* container also provides you with a range of model monitoring capabilities, including constraint validation against a baseline, and emitting Amazon CloudWatch metrics\. This container is based on Spark and is built with [Deequ](https://github.com/awslabs/deequ)\. 

The training dataset that you used to trained the model is usually a good baseline dataset\. The training dataset data schema and the inference dataset schema should exactly match \(the number and order of the features\)\. Note that the prediction/output column\(s\) are assumed to be the 1st column\(s\) in the training dataset\. From the training dataset, you can ask Amazon SageMaker to suggest a set of baseline constraints and generate descriptive statistics to explore the data\. For this example, upload the training dataset that was used to train the pretrained model included in this example\. If you already have it in Amazon S3, you can point to it directly\.

**Create a baseline from a training dataset**: When you have your training data ready and stored in Amazon S3, start a baseline processing job with `DefaultModelMonitor.suggest_baseline(..)` using the [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io)\. This uses an [Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor Pre\-built Container](model-monitor-pre-built-container.md) that generates baseline statistics and suggests baseline constraints for the dataset and writes them to the `output_s3_uri` location that you specify\.

```
from sagemaker.model_monitor import DefaultModelMonitor
from sagemaker.model_monitor.dataset_format import DatasetFormat

my_default_monitor = DefaultModelMonitor(
    role=role,
    instance_count=1,
    instance_type='ml.m5.xlarge',
    volume_size_in_gb=20,
    max_runtime_in_seconds=3600,
)

my_default_monitor.suggest_baseline(
    baseline_dataset=baseline_data_uri+'/training-dataset-with-header.csv',
    dataset_format=DatasetFormat.csv(header=True),
    output_s3_uri=baseline_results_uri,
    wait=True
)
```

**Note**  
If you provide the feature/column names in the training dataset as the 1st row and set the `header=True` option as in the code sample above, Amazon SageMaker uses the feature name in the constraints and statistics file\.

The baseline statistics for the dataset are contained in the statistics\.json file and the suggested baseline constraints are contained in the constraints\.json file in the location you specify with `output_s3_uri`\.


**Table: Output Files for Tabular Dataset Statistics and Constraints**  

| File Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| statistics\.json | This file is expected to have columnar statistics for each feature in the dataset that is analyzed\. See the schema for this file in the [Schema for Statistics \(statistics\.json file\)](model-monitor-byoc-statistics.md) section\.  | 
| constraints\.json | This file is expected to have the constraints on the features observed\. See the schema for this file in the [Schema for Constraints \(constraints\.json file\)](model-monitor-byoc-constraints.md) section\.  | 

The [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io) provides convenience functions described to generate the baseline statistics and constraints\. But if you want to call processing job directly for this purpose instead, you need to set the `Environment` map as in the following example\.

```
"Environment": {
    "dataset_format": "{\"csv\”: { \”header\”: true}",
    "dataset_source": "/opt/ml/processing/sm_input",
    "output_path": "/opt/ml/processing/sm_output",
    "publish_cloudwatch_metrics": "Disabled",
}
```
