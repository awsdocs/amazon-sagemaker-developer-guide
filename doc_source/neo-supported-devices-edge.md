# Supported Frameworks, Devices, Systems, and Architectures<a name="neo-supported-devices-edge"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Neo supports common machine learning frameworks, edge devices, operating systems, and chip architectures\. Find out if Neo supports your framework, edge device, OS, and chip architecture by selecting one of the topics below\.

You can find a list of models that have been tested by the Amazon SageMaker Neo Team in the [Tested Models](neo-supported-edge-tested-models.md) section\.

**Note**  
Ambarella devices require additional files to be included within the compressed TAR file before it is sent for compilation\. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Ambarella Errors](neo-troubleshooting-target-devices-ambarella.md)\.
TIM\-VX \(libtim\-vx\.so\) is required for i\.MX 8M Plus\. For information on how to build TIM\-VX, see the [TIM\-VX GitHub repository](https://github.com/VeriSilicon/TIM-VX)\.
