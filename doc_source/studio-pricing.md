# Amazon SageMaker Studio Pricing<a name="studio-pricing"></a>

The only cost incurred for onboarding to Amazon SageMaker Studio is the one\-time cost for the Amazon Elastic File System \(Amazon EFS\) volume created to store user data, such as files and notebooks\. In the SageMaker Studio Control Panel, when the **Status** displays as `Ready`, the Amazon EFS volume has been created and the cost incurred\. Additional storage charges for the Amazon EFS volume will be incurred as user data is created in Studio\. For pricing information on Amazon EFS, see [Amazon EFS Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/efs/pricing/)\.

Additional costs are incurred when other operations are run inside Studio, for example, creating an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot job, running a notebook, running training jobs, and hosting a model\.
