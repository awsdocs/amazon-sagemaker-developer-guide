# Delete an Amazon SageMaker Studio Domain<a name="gs-studio-delete-domain"></a>

When you onboard to Amazon SageMaker Studio using IAM authentication, Studio creates a domain for your account\. A domain consists of a list of authorized users, configuration settings, and an Amazon Elastic File System \(Amazon EFS\) volume, which contains data for the users, including notebooks, resources, and artifacts\. A user can have multiple applications \(apps\) which support the reading and execution experience of the user’s notebooks, terminals, and consoles\.

To return Studio to the state it was in before you onboarded, you must delete this domain\. The Amazon EFS volume isn't deleted when the domain is deleted\. To delete the EFS volume, see [Manage Your EFS Storage Volume](studio-tasks-manage-storage.md)\.

You must delete the domain if you want to switch authentication modes from IAM to AWS SSO\.

To delete a domain, the domain cannot contain any user profiles\. To delete a user profile, the profile cannot contain any non\-failed apps\.

When you delete these resources, the following occurs:
+ App – The data \(files and notebooks\) in a user's home directory is saved\. Unsaved notebook data is lost\.
+ User profile – The user is no longer able to sign in to Studio and loses access to their home directory but the data is not deleted\. An admin can retrieve the data from the Amazon EFS volume where it is stored under the user's AWS account\.

**Note**  
You must have admin permission to delete a domain\.

You can only delete an app whose status is `InService`, which is displayed as **Ready** in Studio\. An app whose status is `Failed` doesn't need to be deleted to delete the containing domain\. In Studio, an attempt to delete an app in the failed state results in an error\.
