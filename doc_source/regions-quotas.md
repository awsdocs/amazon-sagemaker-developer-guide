# Supported Regions and Quotas<a name="regions-quotas"></a>

For a list of the AWS Regions supported by Amazon SageMaker and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instance types that are available in each Region, see [Amazon SageMaker Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/)\.

Each AWS Region is divided into sub\-regions known as Availability Zones\. For a given Region, the Availability Zones in that Region don't always contain the same instance types supported by Amazon SageMaker\. If any Availability Zone in the Region contains a given instance type, then that instance type is listed as available in the Region\.

For a list of the AWS Regions supported by Amazon SageMaker Studio, see [Amazon SageMaker Studio](studio.md)\.

For a list of the Amazon SageMaker service endpoints for each Region and the Amazon SageMaker service quotas for each instance type, see [Amazon SageMaker endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sagemaker.html)\.

You can request a quota increase using Service Quotas or the AWS Support Center\. To request an increase, see [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.
