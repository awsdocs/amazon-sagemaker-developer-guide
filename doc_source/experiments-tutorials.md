# Example notebooks for Amazon SageMaker Experiments<a name="experiments-tutorials"></a>

The following tutorials demonstrate how to track runs for various model training experiments\. You can view the resulting experiments in Studio after running the notebooks\. To clean up the resources created by a notebook, see [Clean Up Amazon SageMaker Experiment Resources](experiments-cleanup.md)\. For a tutorial that showcases additional features of Studio, see [Amazon SageMaker Studio Tour](gs-studio-end-to-end.md)\.

## Track experiments in a notebook environment<a name="experiments-tutorials-notebooks"></a>

To learn more about tracking experiments in a notebook environment, see the following example notebooks:
+ [Track an experiment while training a Keras model locally](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-experiments/local_experiment_tracking/keras_experiment.html)
+ [Track an experiment while training a Pytorch model locally or in your notebook](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-experiments/local_experiment_tracking/pytorch_experiment.html)

## Track bias and explainability for your experiments with SageMaker Clarify<a name="experiments-tutorials-clarify"></a>

For a step\-by\-step guide on tracking bias and explainability for your experiments, see the following example notebook:
