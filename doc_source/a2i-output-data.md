# Amazon A2I Output Data<a name="a2i-output-data"></a>

When your machine learning workflow sends Amazon A2I a data object, a *human loop* is created and human reviewers receive a *task* to review that data object\. The output data from each human review task is stored in the Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) output bucket you specify in your human review workflow\. The path to the data uses the following pattern where `YYYY/MM/DD/hh/mm/ss` represents the human loop creation date with year \(`YYYY`\), month \(`MM`\) and day \(`DD`\) and the creation time with hour \(`hh`\), minute \(`mm`\) and second \(`ss`\)\. 

```
s3://customer-output-bucket-specified-in-flow-definition/flow-definition-name/YYYY/MM/DD/hh/mm/ss/human-loop-name/output.json
```

The content of your output data depends on the type of [task type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-task-types-general.html) \(built\-in or custom\) and the type of [workforce](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-workforce-management.html) you use\. Your output data always includes the response from the human worker\. Additionally, output data may also include metadata about the human loop, the human reviewer \(worker\), and the data object\. 

Use the following sections to learn more about Amazon A2I output data format for different task types and workforces\. 

## Output Data From Built\-In Task Types<a name="sms-output-data-textract"></a>

Amazon A2I built\-in task types include Amazon Textract and Amazon Rekognition\. In addition to human responses, the output data from one of these tasks includes details about the reason the human loop was created and information about the integrated service used to create the human loop\. Use the following table to learn more about the output data schema for all built\-in task types\. The *value* for each of these parameters depends on the service you use with Amazon A2I\. Refer to the second table in this section for more information about these service\-specific values\.

#### [ Amazon Textract Task Type Output Data ]

When you use the Amazon Textract built\-in integration, you see `'AWS/Textract/AnalyzeDocument/Forms/V1'` as the value for `awsManagedHumanLoopRequestSource` in your output data\.

The `answerContent` parameter contains a `Block` object that includes human responses for all blocks sent to Amazon A2I\.

The `aiServiceResponse` parameter also includes a `Block` object with Amazon Textract's response to the original request sent using to `AnalyzeDocument`\.

To learn more about the parameters you see in the block object, refer to [Block](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/API_Block.html) in the Amazon Textract Developer Guide\.

When you use the Amazon Textract built\-in integration, you see the string `'AWS/Rekognition/DetectModerationLabels/Image/V3'` as the value for `awsManagedHumanLoopRequestSource` in your output data\.

The `answerContent` parameter contains a `moderationLabels` object that contains human responses for all moderation labels sent to Amazon A2I\.

The `aiServiceResponse` parameter also includes a `moderationLabels` object with Amazon Rekognition's response to the original request sent to `DetectModerationLabels`\.

## Output Data From Custom Task Types<a name="sms-output-data-custom"></a>

When you add Amazon A2I to a custom human review workflow, you see the following parameters in the output data returned from human review tasks\. 


****  

| Parameter | Value Type | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `flowDefinitionArn`  |  String  |  The Amazon Resource Number \(ARN\) of the human review workflow \(flow definition\) used to create the human loop\.   | 
|  `humanAnswers`  |  List of JSON objects  | A list of JSON objects that contain worker responses in answerContent\. The value in this parameter is determined by the output received from your [worker task template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-instructions-overview.html)\. If a private workforce is used, worker metadata is included\. To learn more, see [Track Private Worker Activity](#a2i-worker-id-private)\. | 
|  `humanLoopName`  | String | The name of the human loop\. | 
|  `inputContent`  |  JSON Object  |  The input content sent to Amazon A2I in the request to [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai/2019-11-07/APIReference/API_StartHumanLoop.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai/2019-11-07/APIReference/API_StartHumanLoop.html)\.   | 

The following is an example of output data from a custom integration with Amazon A2I and Amazon Transcribe\. In this example, the `inputContent` consists of:
+ A path to an \.mp4 file in Amazon S3 and the video title
+ The transcription returned from Amazon Transcribe \(parsed from Amazon Transcribe output data\)
+ A start and end time used by the worker task template to clip the \.mp4 file and show workers a relevant portion of the video

## Track Private Worker Activity<a name="a2i-worker-id-private"></a>

If you use a private workforce for your human review tasks, Amazon A2I provides information that you can use to track individual workers in task output data\. To identify the worker that worked on the human review task, use the following from the output data in Amazon S3:
+ The `workerId` is unique to each worker\. 
+ In `workerMetadata`, you see the following\.
  + The `identityProviderType` is the service used to manage the private workforce\. 
  + The `issuer` is the Cognito user pool or OIDC Identity Provider \(IdP\) issuer associated with the work team assigned to this human review task\.
  + A unique `sub` identifier refers to the worker\. If you create a workforce using Amazon Cognito, you can retrieve details about this worker \(such as the name or user name\) using this ID using Amazon Cognito\. To learn how, see [Managing and Searching for User Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/how-to-manage-user-accounts.html#manage-user-accounts-searching-user-attributes) in [Amazon Cognito Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/)\.

The following is an example of the output you may see if you use Amazon Cognito to create a private workforce:

```
"workerId": "a12b3cdefg4h5i67",
            "workerMetadata": {
                "identityData": {
                    "identityProviderType": "Cognito",
                    "issuer": "https://cognito-idp.aws-region.amazonaws.com/aws-region_123456789",
                    "sub": "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"
```

 The following is an example of the output you may see if you use your own OIDC IdP to create a private workforce:

```
"workerId": "a12b3cdefg4h5i67",
            "workerMetadata": {
                "identityData": {
                    "identityProviderType": "Oidc",
                    "issuer": "https://example-oidc-ipd.com/adfs",
