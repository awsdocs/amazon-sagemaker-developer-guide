# Demo: Get Started in the Amazon A2I Console<a name="a2i-get-started-console"></a>

The following demo shows you how to get started using Amazon A2I in the Amazon A2I console\. 

The demo gives you the option to use Augmented AI with Amazon Textract for document review or Amazon Rekognition for image content review\.

## Prerequisites<a name="a2i-getting-started-console-prerequisites"></a>

To get started using Amazon A2I, complete the following prerequisites\. 
+ Create an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the workflow for your input and output data\. For example if you are using Amazon A2I with Amazon Textract in us\-east\-1, create your bucket in us\-east\-1\. To create a bucket, follow the instructions in [Create a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide*\. 
+ Do one of the following:
  + If you want to complete the demo using Amazon Textract download [this sample document](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2020/04/17/sample-document-final.png) and place it in your Amazon S3 bucket\.
  + If you want to complete the demo using Amazon Rekognition, download the following [image](https://dhei5unw3vrsx.cloudfront.net/images/yoga_swimwear_resized.jpg) and place it in your Amazon S3 bucket\. 

**Note**  
The Amazon A2I console is embedded in the SageMaker console\. 

## Step 1: Create a Work Team<a name="a2i-get-started-console-step-1"></a>

First, create a work team in the Amazon A2I console and add yourself as a worker so that you can preview the worker review task\.

**Important**  
This walkthrough uses a private work team\. The Amazon A2I private workforce is configured in the Ground Truth area of the SageMaker console and is shared between Amazon A2I and Ground Truth\. 

**To create a private workforce using worker emails**

1. Open the SageMaker console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/sagemaker/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\. 

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Labeling workforces** under **Ground Truth**\.

1. Choose **Private**, then choose **Create private team**\.

1. Choose **Invite new workers by email**\.

1. For this demo, enter your email and any others that you want to be able to preview the human task UI\. You can paste or type a list of up to 50 email addresses, separated by commas, into the email addresses box\.

1. Enter an organization name and contact email\.

1. Optionally, choose an SNS topic to which to subscribe the team so workers are notified by email when new Ground Truth labeling jobs become available\. Amazon SNS notifications are supported by Ground Truth and are not supported by Augmented AI\. If you subscribe workers to SNS notifications, they only receive notifications about Ground Truth labeling jobs\. They do not receive notifications about Augmented AI tasks\. 

1.  Click the **Create private team** button\. 

If you add yourself to a private work team, you receive an email from `no-reply@verificationemail.com` with login information\. Use the link in this email to reset your password and log in to your worker portal\. This is where your human review tasks appear when you create a human loop\.

## Step 2: Create a Human Review Workflow<a name="a2i-get-started-console-step-2"></a>

In this step, you create a human review workflow\. Each human review workflow is created for a specific [task type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-task-types-general.html)\. This demo allows you to choose between the built\-in task types: Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Textract\. 

**To create a human review workflow:**

1. Open the Augmented AI console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/a2i](https://console.aws.amazon.com/a2i/) to access the **Human review workflows** page\. 

1. Select **Create human review workflow**\.

1. In **Workflow settings** enter a workflow **Name**, **S3 bucket**, and the **IAM role** that you created for this demo, with the AWS managed policy AmazonAugmentedAIIntegratedAPIAccess attached\.

1. For **Task type** select **Textract \- Key\-value pair extraction** or **Rekognition \- Image moderation**\.

1. Select the task type that you chose from the following table for instructions for that task type\. 

------
#### [ Amazon Textract \- Key\-value pair extraction ]

   1\. Select **Trigger a human review for specific form keys based on the form key confidence score or when specific form keys are missing\. **

   2\. For **Key name**, enter *Mail Address*\. 

   3\. Set the **identification confidence** threshold between *0* and *99*\. 

   4\. Set the **qualification confidence** threshold between *0* and *99*\.

   5\. Select **Trigger a human review for all form keys identified by Amazon Textract with confidence scores in a specific range\.**

   6\. Set the **identification confidence** threshold between *0* and *90*\. 

   7\. Set the **qualification confidence** threshold between *0* and *90*\.

   This triggers a human review if Amazon Textract returns a confidence score that is less than 99 for *Mail Address* and its key, or if it returns a confidence score less than 90 for any key value pair detected in the document\.

------
#### [ Amazon Rekognition \- Image moderation ]

   1\. Select **Trigger human review for labels identified by Amazon Rekognition based on label confidence score**\.

   2\. Set the **Threshold** between *0* and *98*\. 

   This triggers a human review if Amazon Rekognition returns a confidence score that is less than 98 for an image moderation job\.

------

1. Under **Worker task template creation**, select **Create from a default template**\.

1. Enter a **Template name**\.

1. In **Task description**, copy and paste the following into the text box:

   *Read the instructions carefully and complete the task\.*

1. Under **Workers**, select **Private**\.

1. Choose the private team that you created\.

1. Select **Create**\.

Once your human review workflow is created, it appears in the table on the **Human review workflows** page\. When the **Status** is Active, copy and save the **Workflow ARN**\. You will need this for the next step\. 

## Step 3: Start a Human Loop<a name="a2i-get-started-console-step-3"></a>

You must use an API operation to start a human loop\. There are a variety of language\-specific SDKs that you can use to interact with thse API operations\. To see documentation for each of these SDKs, refer to the **See Also** section in the API documentation\. For example:

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/a2i/getting-started/see-also.png)

For this demo, you will use one of the following APIs:
+ If you chose the Amazon Textract task type, you will use the `[AnalyzeDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/API_AnalyzeDocument.html)` operation\.
+ If you chose the Amazon Rekognition task type, you will use the `[DetectModerationLabels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_DetectModerationLabels.html)` operation\.

You can interact with these APIs using an SageMaker notebook instance \(recommended for new users\) or the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. Choose one of the following ot learn more about these options:
+ To learn more about and set up a notebook instance, see [Use Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances](nbi.md)\.
+ To learn more about and get started using the AWS CLI, see [What Is the AWS Command Line Interface?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide\.
