# Manage Amazon EMR Clusters from Studio<a name="manage-emr-clusters-from-studio"></a>

Administrators can use Service Catalog to define templates\. These templates allow you to create Amazon EMR clusters and make them available to selected users\. Using AWS Service Catalog, administrators can fully control the organizational, security, and networking in Amazon EMR clusters\. Administrators can view, select, and customize templates for their specific workloads\. If they choose, admins can limit exposure to selected configuration parameters, such as only to specific data workers\. Admins can create on\-demand Amazon EMR clusters within SageMaker Studio\. This can be done without manually setting up complex configurations\. Users can also terminate Amazon EMR clusters after use, directly from SageMaker Studio\. 

The topics in this guide provide more details about setting up and using Service Catalog templates, and creating and terminating Amazon EMR clusters\.
