1. Choose the **set up an account** link to open the AWS Single Sign\-On \(AWS SSO\) console\.

1. Choose **Enable AWS SSO**, and then choose **Create AWS organization**\.

   When your organization has been created, the AWS SSO dashboard opens\. AWS also sends you email to verify the email address associated with the organization\.

1. To add a user to your AWS SSO organization, in the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. On the **Users** page, choose **Add user**\. Under **User details**, specify all required fields\. For **Password**, choose **Send an email to the user**\.

1. Choose **Next: Groups** and then **Add user**\. AWS sends an email to the user inviting them to create a password and activate their AWS SSO account\.
