# Models<a name="jumpstart-models"></a>

JumpStart supports models across fifteen of the most popular problem types\. Of the supported problem types, Vision and NLP\-related types total thirteen\. There are eight problem types that support incremental training and fine\-tuning\. For more information about incremental training and hyper\-parameter tuning, see [SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning.html)\.​ JumpStart also supports four popular algorithms for tabular data modeling\.

You can search and browse models from the JumpStart landing page in Studio\. When you select a model, the model detail page provides information about the model, and you can train and deploy your model in a few steps\. The description section describes what you can do with the model, the expected types of inputs and outputs, and the data type needed for fine\-tuning your model\. 

You can also programmatically utilize models with the [SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-prebuilt-models-with-sagemaker-jumpstart)\. 

The list of problem types and links to their example Jupyter notebooks are summarized in the following table\. For a complete list of JumpStart models, see [JumpStart Available Model Table](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/doc_utils/jumpstart.html)\.
