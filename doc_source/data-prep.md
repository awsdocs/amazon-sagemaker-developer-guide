# Prepare and Analyze Datasets<a name="data-prep"></a>

Import, prepare, transform, visualize and analyze data with Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler\. You can integrate Data Wrangler into your machine learning workflows to simplify and streamline data pre\-processing and feature engineering using little to no coding\. You can also add your own Python scripts and transformations to customize your data prep workflow\.

Import data from Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena, and use Data Wrangler to create sophisticated machine learning data prep workflows with built\-in and custom data transformations and analysis including feature target leakage and quick modeling\. 

After you have defined a data prep workflow, or *data flow*, you can integrate it with SageMaker Processing, SageMaker Pipelines, and SageMaker Feature Store, simplify the task of processing, sharing and storing ML training data\. You can also export your data flow to a python script and create a custom ML data prep pipeline\.
