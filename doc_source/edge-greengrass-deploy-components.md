Deploy your components with the AWS IoT console or with the AWS CLI\.

## To deploy your components \(console\)<a name="collapsible-section-gg-deploy-console"></a>

Deploy your AWS IoT Greengrass components with the AWS IoT console\.

1. In the AWS IoT Greengrass console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iot/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/) navigation menu, choose **Deployments**\.

1. On the **Components** page, on the **Public components** tab, choose `aws.greengrass.SageMakerEdgeManager`\.

1. On the `aws.greengrass.SageMakerEdgeManager` page, choose **Deploy**\.

1. From `Add to deployment`, choose one of the following:

   1. To merge this component to an existing deployment on your target device, choose **Add to existing deployment**, and then select the deployment that you want to revise\.

   1. To create a new deployment on your target device, choose **Create new deployment**\. If you have an existing deployment on your device, choosing this step replaces the existing deployment\.

1. On the **Specify target** page, do the following:

   1. Under **Deployment information**, enter or modify the friendly name for your deployment\.

   1. Under **Deployment targets**, select a target for your deployment, and choose **Next**\. You cannot change the deployment target if you are revising an existing deployment\.

1. On the **Select components** page, under **My components**, choose:
   + com\.*<CUSTOM\-COMPONENT\-NAME>*
   + `aws.greengrass.SageMakerEdgeManager`
   + SagemakerEdgeManager\.*<YOUR\-PACKAGING\-JOB>*

1. On the **Configure components** page, choose **com\.greengrass\.SageMakerEdgeManager**, and do the following\.

   1. Choose **Configure component**\.

   1. Under **Configuration update**, in **Configuration to merge**, enter the following configuration\.

      ```
      {
          "DeviceFleetName": "device-fleet-name",
          "BucketName": "DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET"
      }
      ```

      Replace *`device-fleet-name`* with the name of the edge device fleet that you created, and replace *`DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET`* with the name of the Amazon S3 bucket that is associated with your device fleet\.

   1. Choose **Confirm**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Configure advanced settings** page, keep the default configuration settings, and choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Review** page, choose **Deploy**\.

## To deploy your components \(AWS CLI\)<a name="collapsible-section-gg-deploy-cli"></a>

1. Create a ` deployment.json` file to define the deployment configuration for your SageMaker Edge Manager components\. This file should look like the following example\.

   ```
   {
     "targetArn":"targetArn",
     "components": {
       "aws.greengrass.SageMakerEdgeManager": {
         "componentVersion": 1.0.0,
         "configurationUpdate": {
           "merge": {
             "DeviceFleetName": "device-fleet-name",
             "BucketName": "DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET"
           }
         }
       },
       "com.greengrass.SageMakerEdgeManager.ImageClassification": {
         "componentVersion": 1.0.0,
         "configurationUpdate": {
         }
       }, 
       "com.greengrass.SageMakerEdgeManager.ImageClassification.Model": {
         "componentVersion": 1.0.0,
         "configurationUpdate": {
         }
       }, 
     }
   }
   ```
   + In the `targetArn` field, replace *`targetArn`* with the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the thing or thing group to target for the deployment, in the following format:
     + Thing: `arn:aws:iot:region:account-id:thing/thingName`
     + Thing group: `arn:aws:iot:region:account-id:thinggroup/thingGroupName`
   + In the `merge` field, replace *`device-fleet-name`* with the name of the edge device fleet that you created, and replace *`DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET`* with the name of the Amazon S3 bucket that is associated with your device fleet\.
   + Replace the component versions for each component with the latest available version\.

1. Run the following command to deploy the components on the device:

   ```
   $ aws greengrassv2 create-deployment \
       --cli-input-json file://path/to/deployment.json
   ```

The deployment can take several minutes to complete\. In the next step, check the component log to verify that the deployment completed successfully and to view the inference results\.
