# Step 8: Integrating Amazon SageMaker Endpoints into Internet\-facing Applications<a name="getting-started-client-app"></a>

In a production environment, you might have an internet\-facing application sending requests to the endpoint for inference\. The following high\-level example shows how to integrate your model endpoint into your application\.

For an example of how to use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda to set up and deploy a web service that you can call from a client application, see [Call an Amazon SageMaker model endpoint using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/call-an-amazon-sagemaker-model-endpoint-using-amazon-api-gateway-and-aws-lambda/) in the *AWS Machine Learning Blog*\.

1. Create an IAM role that the AWS Lambda service principal can assume\. Give the role permissions to call the Amazon SageMaker `InvokeEndpoint` API\.

1. Create a Lambda function that calls the Amazon SageMaker `InvokeEndpoint` API\.

1. Call the Lambda function from a mobile application\. For an example of how to call a Lambda function from a mobile application using Amazon Cognito for credentials, see [Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda as Mobile Application Backend](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-android-example.html)\.
