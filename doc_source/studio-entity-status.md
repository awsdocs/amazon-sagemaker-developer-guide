# Amazon SageMaker Domain<a name="studio-entity-status"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Domain supports the SageMaker machine learning environments\. SageMaker Domain creates the following entities\. For information on the onboarding steps to create a Domain, see [Onboard to Amazon SageMaker Domain](gs-studio-onboard.md)\.
+  *Domain*: An Amazon SageMaker Domain consists of an associated Amazon Elastic File System \(Amazon EFS\) volume; a list of authorized users; and a variety of security, application, policy, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) configurations\. An AWS account is limited to one Domain per Region\. Users within a Domain can share notebook files and other artifacts with each other\.
+  *UserProfile*: A user profile represents a single user within a Domain, and is the main way to reference a user for the purposes of sharing, reporting, and other user\-oriented features\. This entity is created when a user onboards to the Amazon SageMaker Domain\.
+  *App*: An app represents an application that supports the reading and execution experience of the userâ€™s notebooks, terminals, and consoles\. The type of app can be JupyterServer, KernelGateway, RStudioServerPro, or RSession\. A user may have multiple Apps active simultaneously\.

The following tables describe the status values for the Domain, UserProfile, and App entities\. Where applicable, they also give troubleshooting steps\.
