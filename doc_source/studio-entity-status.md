# Studio Entity Status<a name="studio-entity-status"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Studio creates the following entities for various purposes\.
+  *Domain*: A SageMaker Studio domain consists of an associated Amazon Elastic File System \(Amazon EFS\) volume; a list of authorized users; and a variety of security, application, policy, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) configurations\. An AWS account is limited to one domain per Region\. Users within a domain can share notebook files and other artifacts with each other\.
+  *UserProfile*: A user profile represents a single user within a domain, and is the main way to reference a user for the purposes of sharing, reporting, and other user\-oriented features\. This entity is created when a user onboards to SageMaker Studio\.
+  *App*: An app represents an application that supports the reading and execution experience of the userâ€™s notebooks, terminals, and consoles\. Apps can be either a JupyterServer or a KernelGateway\. This operation is automatically invoked by SageMaker Studio upon access to the associated Domain, and when new kernel configurations are selected by the user\. A user may have multiple Apps active simultaneously\.

The following tables describe the status values for the Domain, UserProfile, and App entities\. Where applicable, they also give troubleshooting steps\.
