# Create an Input Manifest File for a 3D Point Cloud Labeling Job<a name="sms-point-cloud-input-manifest"></a>

When you create a labeling job, you provide an input manifest file where each line of the manifest describes a unit of task to be completed by annotators\. The format of your input manifest file depends on your task type\. 
+ If you are creating a 3D point cloud **object detection** or **semantic segmentation** labeling job, each line in your input manifest file contains information about a single 3D point cloud frame\. This is called a *point cloud frame input manifest*\. To learn more, see [Create a Point Cloud Frame Input Manifest File](sms-point-cloud-single-frame-input-data.md)\. 
+ If you are creating a 3D point cloud **object tracking** labeling job, each line of your input manifest file contains a sequence of 3D point cloud frames and associated data\. This is called a *point cloud sequence input manifest*\. To learn more, see [Create a Point Cloud Sequence Input Manifest](sms-point-cloud-multi-frame-input-data.md)\.
