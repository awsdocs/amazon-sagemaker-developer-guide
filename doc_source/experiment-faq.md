# Experiments FAQs<a name="experiment-faq"></a>

Refer to the following FAQ items for answers to commonly asked questions about SageMaker Experiments\.

## Q\. What is the recommended method to create an experiment?<a name="experiments-faqs-method"></a>

A: Experiments are a collection of runs aimed at finding the best model to solve a problem\. To initialize a run within an experiment, use the SageMaker Python SDK `Run` class\. For more examples, see [Create an Amazon SageMaker Experiment](experiments-create.md)\.

## Q\. Can I create an experiment using SageMaker script mode?<a name="experiments-faqs-script-mode"></a>

Yes\. You can create experiments using SageMaker script mode\. In the Jupyter notebook or Python file you are using to define your estimator, initialize a run using the `Run` class\. Within the run, launch an estimator with your custom entry point script\. Within that entry point script, use the `load_run` method to initialize the run you defined within the entry point script and log your metrics\. For in\-depth examples, see [Track experiments for SageMaker training jobs using script mode](experiments-tutorials.md#experiments-tutorials-scripts)\.

## Q\. What SageMaker jobs automatically create experiments?<a name="experiments-faqs-automatic"></a>

SageMaker Hyperparameter Optimzation \(HPO\) jobs \(also known as tuning jobs\) automatically create experiments to track all the training jobs launched during a hyperparameter search\. All other SageMaker jobs create unassigned runs unless launched from within an experiment\.

## Q\. What kind of SageMaker jobs can I create an experiment for?<a name="experiments-faqs-create"></a>

You can use SageMaker Experiments to track metrics from training jobs, processing jobs, and transform jobs\.

## Q\. Why do I see experiments and runs in the Experiments Studio UI that I did not create using the SageMaker Python SDK?<a name="experiments-faqs-show-jobs"></a>

Experiment runs that are automatically created by SageMaker jobs and containers are visible in the Experiments Studio UI by default\. To hide runs created by SageMaker jobs for a given experiment, choose the settings icon \(![\[The settings icon for Studio.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/icons/Settings_squid.png)\) and toggle **Show jobs**\.

## Q\. Is the SageMaker Experiments SDK still supported?<a name="experiments-faqs-sdk"></a>

Yes, the SageMaker Experiments SDK is still supported\. However, as of [v2\.123\.0](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/releases/tag/v2.123.0), SageMaker Experiments is fully integrated with the SageMaker Python SDK\. We recommend using the SageMaker Python SDK to create experiments and runs\. For more information, see [Create an Amazon SageMaker Experiment](experiments-create.md)\.

## Q\. Can I use distributed training with my experiments?<a name="experiments-faqs-distributed"></a>

A: Yes\. However, metrics for distributed training can be logged only at the epoch level\. Be sure that you only log metrics generated by the leader node, as shown in the following example:

```
...
if rank == 0:
         test_loss, correct, target, pred = test(model, test_loader, device, tracker)
         logger.info(
             "Test Average loss: {:.4f}, Test Accuracy: {:.0f}%;\n".format(
                 test_loss, test_accuracy)
             )
         )
         run.log_metric(name = "train_loss", value = loss.item(), step = epoch)
         run.log_metric(name = "test_loss", value = test_loss, step = epoch)
         run.log_metric(name = "test_accuracy", value = test_accuracy, step = epoch)
         ...
```

For more information, see the [Run a SageMaker Experiment with Pytorch Distributed Data Parallel \- MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-experiments/sagemaker_job_tracking/pytorch_distributed_training_experiment.html) example notebook\.

## Q\. What are unassigned runs?<a name="experiments-faqs-export"></a>

A: All jobs in SageMaker \(training jobs, processing jobs, transform jobs\) correspond to runs\. When launching these jobs, `TrialComponents` are created by default\. `TrialComponents` map directly to runs\. If these jobs are launched without being explicitly associated with an experiment or run, they are created as unassigned runs\. 

## Q\. Do I need to pass the experiment run context to the training script when running a SageMaker training job?<a name="experiments-faqs-context"></a>

A: Yes\. You need to load the run context into the training script, along with the SageMaker session information\.

```
from sagemaker.session import Session
from sagemaker.experiments.run import load_run

session = Session(boto3.session.Session(region_name=args.region))

with load_run(sagemaker_session=session) as run:
    run.log_parameters(
        {"num_train_samples": len(train_set.data), "num_test_samples": len(test_set.data)}
    )
```

## Q\. How do I add a new run to an experiment analysis?<a name="experiments-faqs-analyze"></a>

A: If you already created a comparison for your experiment and want to add a new run to analyze, select all the runs from your previous analysis as well as the new run and choose **Analyze**\. If you don’t see your new run in the resulting analysis page, then refresh the Studio browser\. Note that refreshing your Studio browser may impact your other open tabs\.
