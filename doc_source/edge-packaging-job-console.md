# Package a Model \(Amazon SageMaker Console\)<a name="edge-packaging-job-console"></a>

You can create a SageMaker Edge Manager packaging job using the SageMaker console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/sagemaker/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\. Before continuing, make sure you have satisfied the [Prerequisites](edge-packaging-job.md#edge-packaging-job-prerequisites)\.

   The **Status** column on the **Edge packaging** jobs page should read **IN PROGRESS**\. Once the packaging job is complete, the status updates to **COMPLETED**\.

   Selecting a packaging job directs you to that job's settings\. The **Job settings** section displays the job name, ARN, status, creation time, last modified time, duration of the packaging job, and role ARN\.

   The **Input configuration** section displays the location of the model artifacts, the data input configuration, and the machine learning framework of the model\.

   The **Output configuration** section displays the output location of the packaging job, the target device for which the model was compiled, and any tags you created\.

1. Choose the name of your device fleet to be redirected to the device fleet details\. This page displays the name of the device fleet, ARN, description \(if you provided one\), date the fleet was created, last time the fleet was modified, Amazon S3 bucket URI, AWS KMS key ID \(if provided\), AWS IoT alias \(if provided\), and IAM role\. If you added tags, they appear in the **Device fleet tags** section\.
