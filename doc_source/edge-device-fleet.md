# Set Up Devices and Fleets<a name="edge-device-fleet"></a>

Fleets are collections of logically grouped devices you can use to collect and analyze data\. You can use SageMaker Edge Manager to operate machine learning models on a fleet of smart cameras, smart speakers, robots, and other edge devices\.

Create a fleet and register your devices either programmatically with the AWS SDK for Python \(Boto3\) or through the SageMaker console\.
