# Check Status<a name="edge-device-fleet-check-status"></a>

Check that your device or fleet is connected and sampling data\. Making periodic checks, manually or automatically, allows you to check that your device or fleet is working properly\.

Use the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/) to interactively choose a fleet for a status check\. You can also use the AWS SDK for Python \(Boto3\)\. The following describes different APIs from Boto3 you can use to check the status of your device or fleet\. Use the API that best fits your use case\.
+ **Check an individual device\.**

  To check the status of an individual device, use `DescribeDevice` API\. A list containing one or more models is provided if a models have been deployed to the device\.

  ```
  sagemaker_client.describe_device(
      DeviceName="sample-device-1",
      DeviceFleetName="sample-fleet-name"
  )
  ```

  Running `DescribeDevice` returns:

  ```
  { "DeviceName": "sample-device".
    "Description": "this is a sample device",
    "DeviceFleetName": "sample-device-fleet",
    "IoTThingName": "SampleThing",
    "RegistrationTime": 1600977370,
    "LatestHeartbeat": 1600977370,
    "Models":[
          {
           "ModelName": "sample-model", 
           "ModelVersion": "1.1",
           "LatestSampleTime": 1600977370,
           "LatestInference": 1600977370 
          }
     ]
  }
  ```
+ **Check a fleet of devices\.**

  To check the status of the fleet, use the `GetDeviceFleetReport` API\. Provide the name of the device fleet to get a summary of the fleet\.

  ```
  sagemaker_client.get_device_fleet_report(
      DeviceFleetName="sample-fleet-name"
  )
  ```
+ **Check for a heartbeat\.**

  Each device within a fleet periodically generates a signal, or “heartbeat”\. The heartbeat can be used to check that the device is communicating with Edge Manager\. If the timestamp of the last heartbeat is not being updated, the device may be failing\.

  Check the last heartbeat with made by a device with the `DescribeDevice` API\. Specify the name of the device and the fleet to which the edge device belongs\.

  ```
  sagemaker_client.describe_device(
      DeviceName="sample-device-1",
      DeviceFleetName="sample-fleet-name"
  )
  ```
