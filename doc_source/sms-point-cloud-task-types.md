# 3D Point Cloud Task types<a name="sms-point-cloud-task-types"></a>

You can use Ground Truth 3D point cloud labeling modality for a variety of use cases\. The following list briefly describes each 3D point cloud task type\. For additional details and instructions on how to create a labeling job using a specific task type, select the task type name to see its task type page\. 
+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-point-cloud-object-detection.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-point-cloud-object-detection.html) – Use this task type when you want workers to locate and classify objects in a 3D point cloud by adding and fitting 3D cuboids around objects\. 
+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-point-cloud-object-tracking.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-point-cloud-object-tracking.html) – Use this task type when you want workers to add and fit 3D cuboids around objects to track their movement across a sequence of 3D point cloud frames\. For example, you can use this task type to ask workers to track the movement of vehicles across multiple point cloud frames\.
+ [**3D point cloud semantic segmentation** –](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-point-cloud-semantic-segmentation.html) Use this task type when you want workers to create a point\-level semantic segmentation mask by painting objects in a 3D point cloud using different colors where each color is assigned to one of the classes you specify\. 
+  **3D point cloud adjustment task types** – Each of the task types above has an associated *adjustment* task type that you can use to audit and adjust annotations generated from a 3D point cloud labeling job\. Refer to the task type page of the associated type to learn how to create an adjustment labeling job for that task\.
