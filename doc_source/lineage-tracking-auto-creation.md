# Amazon SageMakerâ€“Created Tracking Entities<a name="lineage-tracking-auto-creation"></a>

Amazon SageMaker automatically creates tracking entities for SageMaker jobs, models, model packages, and endpoints if the data is available\. There is no limit to the number of lineage entities created by SageMaker\.

For information on how you can manually create tracking entities, see [Manually Create Tracking Entities](lineage-tracking-manual-creation.md)\.

## Tracking Entities for SageMaker Jobs<a name="lineage-tracking-auto-creation-jobs"></a>

SageMaker creates a trial component for and associated with each SageMaker job\. SageMaker creates artifacts to track the job metadata and associations between each artifact and the job\.

Artifacts are created for the following job properties and associated with the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the SageMaker job\. The artifact `SourceUri` is listed in parentheses\.

**Training Job**
+ The image that contains the training algorithm \(`TrainingImage`\)\.
+ The data source of each input channel \(`S3Uri`\)\.
+ The location for the model \(`S3OutputPath)`\.
+ The location for the managed spot checkpoint data \(`S3Uri`\)\.

**Processing Job**
+ The container to be run by the processing job \(`ImageUri`\)\.
+ The data location for each processing input and processing output \(`S3Uri`\)\.

**Transform Job**
+ The input data source to be transformed \(`S3Uri`\)\.
+ The results of the transform \(`S3OutputPath`\)\.

**Note**  
Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) artifacts are tracked based on the Amazon S3 URI values provided to the Create API, for example [CreateTrainingJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrainingJob.html), and not on the Amazon S3 key and hash or etag values from each file\.

## Tracking Entities for Model Packages<a name="lineage-tracking-auto-creation-model-package"></a>

The following entities are created:

**Model Packages**
+ A context for each model package group\.
+ An artifact for each model package\.
+ An association between each model package artifact and the context for each model package group to which the package belongs to\.
+ An action for the creation of a model package version\.
+ An association between the model package artifact and the creation action\.
+ An association between the model package artifact and each model package group context to which the package belongs to\.
+ Inference containers
  + An artifact for the image used in each container defined in the model package\.
  + An artifact for the model used in each container\.
  + An association between each artifact and the model package artifact\.
+ Algorithms
  + An artifact for each algorithm defined in the model package\.
  + An artifact for the model created by each algorithm\.
  + An association between each artifact and the model package artifact\.

## Tracking Entities for Endpoints<a name="lineage-tracking-auto-creation-endpoint"></a>

The following entities are created by Amazon SageMaker:

**Endpoints**
+ A context for each endpoint
+ An action for the model deployment that created each endpoint
+ An artifact for each model deployed to the endpoint
+ An artifact for the image used in the model
+ An artifact for the model package for the model
+ An artifact for each image deployed to the endpoint
+ An association between each artifact and the model deployment action
