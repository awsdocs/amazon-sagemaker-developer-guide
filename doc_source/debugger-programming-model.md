# Programming Model for Debugger<a name="debugger-programming-model"></a>

The programming model is organized around three main constructs that characterize Amazon SageMaker Debugger training jobs: trial, tensor, mode, and rules\. 
+ **Trial**: A smdebug`trial` is an object which lets you query for tensors for a given Debugger training job, specified by the path where smdebug's artifacts are saved\. Trial is capable of loading new tensors as and when they become available at the given path, allowing you to do both offline as well as realtime analysis\. For information on methods in the smdebug Trial API, see [Trial API](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/analysis.md#trial-api)\. 
+ **Tensor**: Tensors define the state of the training job at any API particular instant in its lifecycle\. An smdebug Tensor object can be retrieved through the `trial.tensor(name)` API\. It is uniquely identified by the string representing its name\. For information on methods in the smdebug Tensor API, see [Tensor API](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/analysis.md#tensor-1)\. For information on how to enable or disable a refresh of tensors when querying a trial with `smdebug.analysis.utils`, see [Utils](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/analysis.md#utils)\.
+ **Rule**: Debugger uses rules to execute a certain piece of code regularly on different steps of the jobs\. A rule is assigned to a trial and can be invoked at each new step of the trial\. You can evaluate a rule using tensors from the current step or any step before the current step\. You must ensure that your logic respects these semantics, else you get a `TensorUnavailableForStep` exception as the data would not yet be available for future steps\. You can use the build\-in rules that Debugger provides or you can write your own custom rules\. For information on how to write a custom rule, see [How to Use Custom Rules](debugger-custom-rules.md)\. For information on how to use built\-in rules, see [How to Use Built\-in Rules for Model Analysis](use-debugger-built-in-rules.md)\.
