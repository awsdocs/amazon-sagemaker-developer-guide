## Amazon SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK<a name="studio-jumpstart-industry-pysdk"></a>

SageMaker JumpStart provides processing tools for curating industry datasets and fine\-tuning pretrained models through its client library called SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK\. For detailed API documentation of the SDK, and to learn more about processing and enhancing industry text datasets for improving the performance of state\-of\-the\-art models on SageMaker JumpStart, see the [SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK open source documentation](https://sagemaker-jumpstart-industry-pack.readthedocs.io)\.

## Amazon SageMaker JumpStart Industry Solution<a name="studio-jumpstart-industry-solutions"></a>

SageMaker JumpStart Industry provides the following solution notebook:
+ **Corporate Credit Rating Prediction – Financial Services**

This SageMaker JumpStart Industry solution provides a template for a text\-enhanced corporate credit rating model\. It shows how to take a model based on numeric features \(in this case, Altman's famous 5 financial ratios\) combined with texts from SEC filings to achieve an improvement in the prediction of credit ratings\. In addition to the 5 Altman ratios, you can add more variables as needed or set custom variables\. This solution notebook shows how SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK helps process NLP scoring of texts from SEC filings\. Furthermore, the solution demonstrates how to train a model using the enhanced dataset to achieve a best\-in\-class model, deploy the model to a SageMaker endpoint for production, and receive improved predictions in real time\.

**Note**  
The SageMaker JumpStart Industry solutions, model cards, and example notebooks are hosted and runnable only through SageMaker Studio\. Log in to the [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker), and launch SageMaker Studio\.

## Amazon SageMaker JumpStart Industry Models<a name="studio-jumpstart-industry-models"></a>

SageMaker JumpStart Industry provides the following pretrained [Robustly Optimized BERT approach \(RoBERTa\)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11692.pdf) models:
+ **RoBERTa\-SEC\-Base **
+ **RoBERTa\-SEC\-WIKI\-Base **
+ **RoBERTa\-SEC\-Large **
+ **RoBERTa\-SEC\-WIKI\-Large **

The RoBERTa\-SEC\-Base and RoBERTa\-SEC\-Large models are the text embedding models based on [GluonNLP's RoBERTa model](https://nlp.gluon.ai/master/_modules/gluonnlp/models/roberta.html) and pre\-trained on S&P 500 SEC 10\-K/10\-Q reports of the decade of the 2010's \(from 2010 to 2019\)\. In addition to these, SageMaker JumpStart Industry provides two more RoBERTa variations, RoBERTa\-SEC\-WIKI\-Base and RoBERTa\-SEC\-WIKI\-Large, which are pretrained on the SEC filings and common texts of Wikipedia\. 

By deploying the model cards through SageMaker JumpStart, you'll be able to access their corresponding notebooks\. The paired notebooks will walk you through how the pretrained models can be fine\-tuned for specific classification tasks on multimodal datasets, which are enhanced by the SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK\.

**Note**  
The model notebooks are for demonstration purposes only\. They should not be relied on as financial or investment advice\.

## Amazon SageMaker JumpStart Industry Example Notebooks<a name="studio-jumpstart-industry-examples"></a>

SageMaker JumpStart Industry provides the following hands\-on examples of solving industry\-focused ML problems:
+ **SEC Filings Retrieval w/ Summarizer and Scoring** – This example introduces how to use the SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK for processing the SEC filings, such as text summarization and scoring texts based on NLP score types and their corresponding word lists\. To preview the content of this notebook, see [Simple Construction of a Multimodal Dataset from SEC Filings and NLP Scores](https://sagemaker-jumpstart-industry-pack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/finance/notebook1/SEC_Retrieval_Summarizer_Scoring.html)
+ **ML on a TabText \(Multimodal\) Dataset** – This example shows how to merge different types of datasets into a single dataframe called TabText and perform multimodal ML\. To preview the content of this notebook, see [Machine Learning on a TabText Dataframe – An Example Based on the Paycheck Protection Program](https://sagemaker-jumpstart-industry-pack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/finance/notebook2/PPP_TabText_ML.html)
+ **Multi\-category ML on SEC filings data** – This example shows how to train an AutoGluon NLP model over the multimodal \(TabText\) datasets curated from SEC filings for a multiclass classification task\.
