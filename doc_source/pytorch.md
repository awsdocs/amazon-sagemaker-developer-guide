# Use PyTorch with Amazon SageMaker<a name="pytorch"></a>

You can use Amazon SageMaker to train and deploy a model using custom PyTorch code\. The SageMaker Python SDK PyTorch estimators and models and the SageMaker open\-source PyTorch container make writing a PyTorch script and running it in SageMaker easier\.

## What do you want to do?<a name="pytorch-intent"></a>

I want to train a custom PyTorch model in SageMaker\.  
For a sample Jupyter notebook, see the [PyTorch example notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/pytorch_mnist) in the Amazon SageMaker Examples GitHub repository\.  
For documentation, see [Train a Model with PyTorch](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_pytorch.html#train-a-model-with-pytorch)\.

I have a PyTorch model that I trained in SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a hosted endpoint\.  
For more information, see [Deploy PyTorch models](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_pytorch.html#deploy-pytorch-models)\.

I have a PyTorch model that I trained outside of SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a SageMaker endpoint  
For more information, see [Deploy Endpoints from Model Data](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_pytorch.html#deploy-endpoints-from-model-data)\.

I want to see the API documentation for [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io) PyTorch classes\.  
For more information, see [PyTorch Classes](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sagemaker.pytorch.html)\.

I want to find the SageMaker PyTorch container repository\.  
For more information, see [SageMaker PyTorch Container GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-pytorch-container)\.

I want to find information about PyTorch versions supported by AWS Deep Learning Containers\.  
For more information, see [Available Deep Learning Container Images](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md)\.

 For general information about writing PyTorch training scripts and using PyTorch estimators and models with SageMaker, see [Using PyTorch with the SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_pytorch.html)\.
