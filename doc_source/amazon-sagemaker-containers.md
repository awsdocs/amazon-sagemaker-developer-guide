# Create Docker Containers with the Amazon SageMaker Containers Library<a name="amazon-sagemaker-containers"></a>

[Amazon SageMaker Containers](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-containers) is a library that implements the functionality that you need to create containers to run scripts, train algorithms, and deploy models on Amazon SageMaker\. When installed, the library defines the following for users:
+  The locations for storing code and other resources\. 
+ The entry point that contains the code to run when the container is started\. Your Dockerfile must copy the code that needs to be run into the location expected by a container that is compatible with Amazon SageMaker\. 
+ Other information that a container needs to manage deployments for training and inference\. 

To install the Amazon SageMaker Containers library, use the `RUN pip install sagemaker-containers` command in your Dockerfile\. 

After you build a Docker image, you push it to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry \(Amazon ECR\)\. To create a container, you pull the image from Amazon ECR and then build the container using the `docker build` command\.

When Amazon SageMaker trains a model, it creates the following file folder structure in the container's `/opt/ml` directory\.

```
/opt/ml
├── input
│   ├── config
│   │   ├── hyperparameters.json
│   │   └── resourceConfig.json
│   └── data
│       └── <channel_name>
│           └── <input data>
├── model
│
├── code
│
├── output
│
└── failure
```

When you run a model *training* job, the Amazon SageMaker container uses the `/opt/ml/input/` directory, which contains the JSON files that configure the hyperparameters for the algorithm and the network layout used for distributed training\. The `/opt/ml/input/` directory also contains files that specify the channels through which Amazon SageMaker accesses the data, which is stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)\. The Amazon SageMaker Containers library places the scripts that the container will run in the `/opt/ml/code/` directory\. Your script should write the model generated by your algorithm to the `/opt/ml/model/` directory\. For more information, see [Use Your Own Training Algorithms](your-algorithms-training-algo.md)\.

When you *host* a trained model on Amazon SageMaker to make inferences, you deploy the model to an HTTP endpoint\. The model makes real\-time predictions in response to inference requests\. The container must contain a serving stack to process these requests\.

In a hosting or batch transform container, the model files are located in the same folder that they were written to during training\.

```
/opt/ml/model
│
└── <model files>
```

For more information, see [Use Your Own Inference Code](your-algorithms-inference-main.md)\.

You can provide separate Docker images for the training algorithm and for the inference code\. Or you can use a single Docker image for both\. When creating Docker images for use with Amazon SageMaker, consider the following:
+ Providing two Docker images can increase storage requirements and cost because common libraries might be duplicated\.
+ In general, smaller containers start faster for both training and hosting\. Models train faster and the hosting service can react to increases in traffic by automatically scaling more quickly\.
+ You might be able to write an inference container that is significantly smaller than the training container\. This is especially common when you use GPUs for training, but your inference code is optimized for CPUs\.
+  Amazon SageMaker requires that Docker containers run without privileged access\.
+ Both Docker containers that you build and those provided by Amazon SageMaker can send messages to the `Stdout` and `Stderr` files\. Amazon SageMaker sends these messages to Amazon CloudWatch logs in your AWS account\.
