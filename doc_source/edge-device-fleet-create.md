# Create a Fleet<a name="edge-device-fleet-create"></a>

You can create a fleet programmatically with the AWS SDK for Python \(Boto3\) or through the SageMaker console [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/sagemaker](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\.

## Create a Fleet \(Boto3\)<a name="edge-device-fleet-create-boto3"></a>

Use the `CreateDeviceFleet` API to create a fleet\. Specify a name for the fleet, your AWS IoT Role ARN for the `RoleArn` field, as well as an Amazon S3 URI where you want the device to store sampled data\.

You can optionally include a description of the fleet, tags, and an AWS KMS Key ID\.

```
import boto3

# Create SageMaker client so you can interact and manage SageMaker resources
sagemaker_client = boto3.client("sagemaker", region_name="aws-region")

sagemaker_client.create_device_fleet(
    DeviceFleetName="sample-fleet-name",
    RoleArn="arn:aws:iam::999999999:role/rolename", # IoT Role ARN
    Description="fleet description",
    OutputConfig={
        S3OutputLocation="s3://bucket/",
        KMSKeyId: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
    },
        Tags=[
        {
            "Key": "string", 
            "Value" : "string"
         }
     ],
)
```

An AWS IoT Role Alias is created for you when you create a device fleet\. The AWS IoT role alias provides a mechanism for connected devices to authenticate to AWS IoT using X\.509 certificates and then obtain short\-lived AWS credentials from an IAM role that is associated with the AWS IoT role alias\.

Use `DescribeDeviceFleet` to get the role alias name and ARN\.

```
# Print Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and alias that has access 
# to AWS Internet of Things (IoT).
sagemaker_client.describe_device_fleet(DeviceFleetName=device_fleet_name)['IotRoleAlias']
```

Use `DescribeDeviceFleet` API to get a description of fleets you created\.

```
sagemaker_client.describe_device_fleet(
    DeviceFleetName="sample-fleet-name"
)
```

By default, it returns the name of the fleet, the device fleet ARN, the Amazon S3 bucket URI, the IAM role, the role alias created in AWS IoT, a timestamp of when the fleet was created, and a timestamp of when the fleet was last modified\.

```
{ "DeviceFleetName": "sample-fleet-name",
  "DeviceFleetArn": "arn:aws:sagemaker:us-west-2:9999999999:device-fleet/sample-fleet-name",
  "IAMRole": "arn:aws:iam::999999999:role/rolename",
  "Description": "this is a sample fleet",
  "IoTRoleAlias": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:9999999999:rolealias/SagemakerEdge-sample-fleet-name"
  "OutputConfig": {
              "S3OutputLocation": "s3://bucket/folder",
              "KMSKeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
   },
   "CreationTime": "1600977370",
   "LastModifiedTime": "1600977370"}
```

## Create a Fleet \(Console\)<a name="edge-device-fleet-create-console"></a>

You can create a Edge Manager packaging job using the Amazon SageMaker console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/sagemaker](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\.

1. In the SageMaker console, choose **Edge Manager** and then choose **Edge device fleets**\.

1. Choose **Create device fleet**\.

1. Enter a name for the device fleet in the **Device fleet name** field\. Choose **Next**\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/smith/create-device-fleet-filled.png)

1. On the **Output configuration** page, specify the Amazon S3 bucket URI where you want to store sample data from your device fleet\. You can optionally add an encryption key as well by electing an existing AWS KMS key from the dropdown list or by entering a keyâ€™s ARN\. Choose **Submit**\.

1. Choose the name of your device fleet to be redirected to the device fleet details\. This page displays the name of the device fleet, ARN, description \(if you provided one\), date the fleet was created, last time the fleet was modified, Amazon S3 bucket URI, AWS KMS key ID \(if provided\), AWS IoT alias \(if provided\), and IAM role\. If you added tags, they appear in the **Device fleet tags** section\.
