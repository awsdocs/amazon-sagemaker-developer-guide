# Amazon SageMaker Feature Store Notebook Examples<a name="feature-store-notebooks"></a>

To get started using Amazon SageMaker Feature Store, you can choose from a variety of example Jupyter notebooks in the table below\. If this is your first time using Feature Store, try out the Introduction to Feature Store notebook\. To run any these notebooks, you must attach this policy to your IAM execution role: `AmazonSageMakerFeatureStoreAccess`\. 

 See [IAM Roles](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles) to access your role and attach this policy\. For a walkthrough see [Adding policies to your IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/feature-store-adding-policies.html)\. The following screenshot illustrates how the policy appears under your IAM role after it has been attached\.
