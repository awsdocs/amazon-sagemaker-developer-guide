# Instance Types for Built\-in Algorithms<a name="cmn-info-instance-types"></a>

For training and hosting Amazon SageMaker algorithms, we recommend using the following Amazon EC2 instance types:
+  ml\.m5\.xlarge, ml\.m5\.4xlarge, and ml\.m5\.10xlarge
+  ml\.c5\.xlarge, ml\.c5\.2xlarge, and ml\.c5\.8xlarge 
+  ml\.p3\.xlarge, ml\.p3\.8xlarge, and ml\.p3\.16xlarge 

Most Amazon SageMaker algorithms have been engineered to take advantage of GPU computing for training\. Despite higher per\-instance costs, GPUs train more quickly, making them more cost effective\. Exceptions are noted in this guide\.

The size and type of data can have a great effect on which hardware configuration is most effective\. When the same model is trained on a recurring basis, initial testing across a spectrum of instance types can discover configurations that are more cost\-effective in the long run\. Additionally, algorithms that train most efficiently on GPUs might not require GPUs for efficient inference\. Experiment to determine the most cost effectiveness solution\.
