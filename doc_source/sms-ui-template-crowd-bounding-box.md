# crowd\-bounding\-box<a name="sms-ui-template-crowd-bounding-box"></a>

A widget for drawing rectangles on an image and assigning a label to the portion of the image that is enclosed in each rectangle\.

## Attributes<a name="bounding-box-attributes"></a>

The following attributes are supported by this element\.

### header<a name="bounding-box-attributes-header"></a>

The text to display above the image\. This is typically a question or simple instruction for the worker\.

### labels<a name="bounding-box-attributes-labels"></a>

A JSON formatted array of strings, each of which is a label that a worker can assign to the image portion enclosed by a rectangle\.

### name<a name="bounding-box-attributes-name"></a>

The name of this widget\. It's used as a key for the widget's input in the form output\.

### src<a name="bounding-box-attributes-src"></a>

The URL of the image on which to draw bounding boxes\. 

### initial\-value<a name="bounding-box-attributes-initialValue"></a>

An array of JSON objects, each of which sets a bounding box when the component is loaded\. Each JSON object in the array contains the following properties\.
+ **height** – The height of the box in pixels\.
+ **label** – The text assigned to the box as part of the labeling task\. This text must match one of the labels defined in the *labels* attribute of the <crowd\-bounding\-box> element\.
+ **left** – Distance of the top\-left corner of the box from the left side of the image, measured in pixels\.
+ **top** – Distance of the top\-left corner of the box from the top of the image, measured in pixels\.
+ **width** – The width of the box in pixels\.

## Output<a name="bounding-box-output"></a>

The following output is supported by this element\.

### boundingBoxes<a name="bounding-box-output-boundingBoxes"></a>

An array of JSON objects, each of which specifies a bounding box that has been created by the worker\. Each JSON object in the array contains the following properties\.
+ **height** – The height of the box in pixels\.
+ **label** – The text assigned to the box as part of the labeling task\. This text must match one of the labels defined in the *labels* attribute of the <crowd\-bounding\-box> element\.
+ **left** – Distance of the top\-left corner of the box from the left side of the image, measured in pixels\.
+ **top** – Distance of the top\-left corner of the box from the top of the image, measured in pixels\.
+ **width** – The width of the box in pixels\.

### inputImageProperties<a name="bounding-box-output-inputImageProperties"></a>

A JSON object that specifies the dimensions of the image that is being annotated by the worker\. This object contains the following properties\.
+ **height** – The height, in pixels, of the image\.
+ **width** – The width, in pixels, of the image\.
