# Prebuilt Amazon SageMaker Docker Images for TensorFlow, MXNet, Chainer, and PyTorch<a name="pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning"></a>

Amazon SageMaker provides prebuilt Docker images that include deep learning framework libraries and other dependencies needed for training and inference\. With the [Amazon SageMaker SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk#installing-the-sagemaker-python-sdk), you can train and deploy models using these popular deep learning frameworks\. For instructions on installing and using the SDK, see [https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk#installing-the-sagemaker-python-sdk](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk#installing-the-sagemaker-python-sdk)\. 

The following table provides links to the GitHub repositories that contain the source code and Dockerfiles for each framework and for TensorFlow and MXNet Serving\. The instructions linked are for using the Python SDK to run training algorithms and host models on Amazon SageMaker\.

If you are not using the [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io) and one of its estimators to retrieve the pre\-built images, you have to retrieve them yourself\. The Amazon SageMaker prebuilt Docker images are stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry \(Amazon ECR\)\. For a complete list of the available pre\-built Docker images, see [Deep Learning Containers Images](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md)\.

Amazon SageMaker also provides prebuilt Docker images for scikit\-learn and Spark ML\. For information about Docker images that enable using scikit\-learn and Spark ML solutions in Amazon SageMaker, see [Prebuilt Amazon SageMaker Docker Images for Scikit\-learn and Spark ML ](pre-built-docker-containers-frameworks.md)\.

You can use prebuilt containers to deploy your custom models or models that have been trained in a framework other than Amazon SageMaker\. For an overview of the process of bringing the trained model artifacts into Amazon SageMaker and hosting them at an endpoint, see [Bring Your Own Pretrained MXNet or TensorFlow Models into Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/bring-your-own-pre-trained-mxnet-or-tensorflow-models-into-amazon-sagemaker/)\.

You can customize these prebuilt containers or extend them to handle any additional functional requirements for your algorithm or model that the prebuilt Amazon SageMaker Docker image doesn't support\. For an example, see [Extending Our PyTorch Containers](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/pytorch_extending_our_containers/pytorch_extending_our_containers.ipynb)\.
