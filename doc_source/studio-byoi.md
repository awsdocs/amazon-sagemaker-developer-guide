# Bring your own SageMaker image<a name="studio-byoi"></a>

A SageMaker image consists of the kernels, language packages, and other files required to run a Jupyter notebook in Amazon SageMaker Studio\. Amazon SageMaker provides built\-in images and you can also use your own custom images in Studio\.

A SageMaker *image* is a holder for a set of SageMaker *image versions*\. An image version represents a container image that is compatible with SageMaker Studio and stored in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry \(ECR\) repository\. Each image version is immutable\.

To make a custom SageMaker image available to all users within a domain, you attach the image to the domain\. To make an image available to a single user, you attach the image to the user's profile\. When you attach an image, SageMaker uses the latest image version by default\. You can also attach a specific image version\. After you attach the version, you can choose the version from the SageMaker Launcher or the image selector when you launch a notebook\.

You can create images and image versions, and attach image versions to your domain, using the SageMaker Studio control panel, the [AWS SDK for Python \(Boto3\)](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/sagemaker.html), and the [AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sagemaker/)\. You can also create images and image versions using the SageMaker console, even if you haven't onboarded to Studio\.

SageMaker provides a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/sagemaker-studio-custom-image-samples/) of sample Dockerfiles to use as a starting point for your custom SageMaker images\. These include Dockerfiles for the following images:
+ Julia
+ R
+ Scala
+ Tensorflow 2
