Use the following information to sign up for an AWS account\. If you already have an AWS account, skip this step\.

## Sign up for an AWS account<a name="sign-up-for-aws"></a>

If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)\.

AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign\-up process is complete\. At any time, you can view your current account activity and manage your account by going to [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choosing **My Account**\.

## Create an administrative user<a name="create-an-admin"></a>

After you sign up for an AWS account, create an administrative user so that you don't use the root user for everyday tasks\.

**Secure your AWS account root user**

1.  Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) as the account owner by choosing **Root user** and entering your AWS account email address\. On the next page, enter your password\.

   For help signing in by using root user, see [Signing in as the root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/console-sign-in-tutorials.html#introduction-to-root-user-sign-in-tutorial) in the *AWS Sign\-In User Guide*\.

1. Turn on multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) for your root user\.

   For instructions, see [Enable a virtual MFA device for your AWS account root user \(console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html#enable-virt-mfa-for-root) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**Create an administrative user**
+ For your daily administrative tasks, grant administrative access to an administrative user in AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\)\.

  For instructions, see [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) User Guide*\.

**Sign in as the administrative user**
+ To sign in with your IAM Identity Center user, use the sign\-in URL that was sent to your email address when you created the IAM Identity Center user\.

  For help signing in using an IAM Identity Center user, see [Signing in to the AWS access portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/iam-id-center-sign-in-tutorial.html) in the *AWS Sign\-In User Guide*\.
