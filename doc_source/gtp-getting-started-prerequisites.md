# Set Up Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus Prerequisites<a name="gtp-getting-started-prerequisites"></a>

Use the following information to sign up for an AWS account\. If you already have an AWS account, skip this step\.

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all AWS services, including SageMaker\. You are charged only for the services that you use\. 

**To create an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root)\.

Write down your AWS account ID because you need it for the next task\.

AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign up process is complete\. At any time, you can view your current account activity and manage your account by going to [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choosing **My Account**\.
