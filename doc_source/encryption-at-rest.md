# Protect Data at Rest Using Encryption<a name="encryption-at-rest"></a>

To protect your model\-building data and model artifacts, you can use encrypted Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) buckets\. To encrypt the machine learning \(ML\) storage volume that is attached to notebooks, processing jobs, training jobs, hyperparameter tuning jobs, batch transform jobs, and endpoints, you can pass a AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) key to Amazon SageMaker \. If you don't specify a KMS key, Amazon SageMaker encrypts storage volumes with a transient key and discards it immediately after encrypting the storage volume\.

You can use an AWS managed KMS key to encrypt all instance OS volumes\. You can encrypt all ML data volumes for all Amazon SageMaker instances with a KMS key that you specify\. ML storage volumes are mounted as follows:
+ Notebooks \- `/home/ec2-user/SageMaker`
+ Processing \- `/opt/ml/processing` and `/tmp/` 
+ Training \- `/opt/ml/` and `/tmp/`
+  Batch \- `/opt/ml/` and `/tmp/`
+ Endpoints \- `/opt/ml/` and `/tmp/` 

Processing, batch transform, and training job containers and their storage are ephemeral in nature\. When the job completes, output is uploaded to Amazon S3 using AWS KMS encryption \(with an optional KMS key you specify\) and the instance is torn down\. 

**Important**  
Sensitive data that needs to be encrypted with a KMS key for compliance reasons should be stored in the ML storage volume or in Amazon S3, both of which can be encrypted using a KMS key you specify\. 

When you open a notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker saves it and any files associated with it in the Amazon SageMaker folder in the ML storage volume by default\. When you stop a notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker creates a snapshot of the ML storage volume\. Any customizations to the operating system of the stopped instance, such as installed custom libraries or operating system level settings, are lost\. Consider using a lifecycle configuration to automate customizations of the default notebook instance\. When you terminate an instance, the snapshot and the ML storage volume are deleted\. Any data that you need to persist beyond the lifespan of the notebook instance should be transferred to an Amazon S3 bucket\.

**Note**  
Certain Nitro\-based Amazon SageMaker instances include local storage, depending on the instance type\. Local storage volumes are encrypted using a hardware module on the instance\. You can't use a KMS key on an instance type with local storage\. For a list of instance types that support local instance storage, see [Instance Store Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#instance-store-volumes)\.
