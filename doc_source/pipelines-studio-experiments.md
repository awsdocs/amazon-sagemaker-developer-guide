# View Experiment Entities Created by SageMaker Pipelines<a name="pipelines-studio-experiments"></a>

When you create a pipeline and specify [pipeline\_experiment\_config](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/workflows/pipelines/sagemaker.workflow.pipelines.html#sagemaker.workflow.pipeline.Pipeline.pipeline_experiment_config), SageMaker Pipelines creates the following SageMaker Experiments entities by default if they don't exist:
+ An experiment for the pipeline
+ A trial for every execution of the pipeline
+ A trial component for each SageMaker job created in a pipeline step

For information on how experiments are integrated with pipelines, see [Amazon SageMaker Experiments Integration](pipelines-experiments.md)\. For more information on SageMaker Experiments, see [Manage Machine Learning with Amazon SageMaker Experiments](experiments.md)\.

You can get to the list of trial components associated with a pipeline from either the pipeline executions list or the experiments list\.

**To view the trial components list from the pipeline executions list**

1. To view the pipeline executions list, follow the first four steps in [View a Pipeline](pipelines-studio-list-pipelines.md)\.

1. On the top right of the screen, choose the **Settings** icon \( ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/icons/Settings_squid.png) \) to open **TABLE PROPERTIES**\.

1. Select **Experiment**\. If experiment integration wasn't disabled when the pipeline was created, the experiment name and trial name are displayed in the executions list\.
**Note**  
Experiments integration was introduced in v2\.41\.0 of the [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io)\. Pipelines created with an earlier version of the SDK aren't integrated with experiments by default\.

1. Select one or more executions, open \(right\-click\) the selection, then choose **View trial components generated by execution**\.

**To view the trial components list from the experiments list**

1. In the left sidebar of Studio, choose the **Components and registries** icon \( ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/icons/Components_registries.png)\)\.

1. Select **Experiments and trials** from the dropdown list\.

1. Use search to filter the list to experiments created by a pipeline\.

   1. Drag the right border of the **Components and registries** pane to the right until you can see the **Experiment type** column\.

   1. In the search box, enter `ex` and choose **Experiment type**\.

   1. In **Filter by values**, choose **Pipeline**, then choose **Apply**\.

   To further narrow the search, you can add additional filters\. For more information, see [Search Experiments Using Amazon SageMaker Studio](experiments-search-studio.md)\.

1. Open \(right\-click\) an experiment name and choose **Open in trial component list**\.
