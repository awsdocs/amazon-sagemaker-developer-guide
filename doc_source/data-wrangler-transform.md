# Transform Data<a name="data-wrangler-transform"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler provides numerous ML data transforms to streamline cleaning, transforming, and featurizing your data\. When you add a transform, it adds a step to the data flow\. Each transform you add modifies your dataset and produces a new dataframe\. All subsequent transforms apply to the resulting dataframe\.

Data Wrangler includes built\-in transforms, which you can use to transform columns without any code\. You can also add custom transformations using PySpark, Pandas, and PySpark SQL\. Some transforms operate in place, while others create a new output column in your dataset\.

You can apply transforms to multiple columns at once\. For example, you can delete multiple columns in a single step\.

You can apply the process numeric and handle missing transforms only to a single column\.

Use this page to learn more about these built\-in and custom transforms\.

## Transform UI<a name="data-wrangler-transform-ui"></a>

Most of the built\-in transforms are located in the **Prepare** tab of the Data Wrangler UI\. The Join and Concatenate transforms are accessed through the data flow view\. Use the following table to preview these two views\.

## Join Datasets<a name="data-wrangler-transform-join"></a>

You join dataframes directly in your data flow\. When you join two datasets, the resulting joined dataset appears in your flow\. The following join types are supported by Data Wrangler\.
+ **Left Outer** – Include all rows from the left table\. If the value for the column joined on in a left table row does not match any right table row values, that row contains null values for all right table columns in the joined table\.
+ **Left Anti** – Include rows from the left table that do not contain values in the right table for the joined column\.
+ **Left semi** – Include a single row from the left table for all identical rows that satisfy the criteria in the join statement\. This excludes duplicate rows from the left table that match the criteria of the join\.
+ **Right Outer** – Include all rows from the right table\. If the value for the joined column in a right table row does not match any left table row values, that row contains null values for all left table columns in the joined table\.
+ **Inner** – Include rows from left and right tables that contain matching values in the joined column\. 
+ **Full Outer** – Include all rows from the left and right tables\. If the row value for the joined column in either table does not match, separate rows are created in the joined table\. If a row doesn’t contain a value for a column in the joined table, null is inserted for that column\.
+ **Cartesian Cross** – Include rows which combine each row from the first table with each row from the second table\. This is a [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of rows from tables in the join\. The result of this product is the size of the left table times the size of the right table\. Therefore, we recommend caution in using this join between very large datasets\. 

Use the following procedure to join two dataframes\.

1. Select **\+** next to the left dataframe that you want to join\. The first dataframe you select is always the left table in your join\. 

1. Select **Join**\.

1. Select the right dataframe\. The second dataframe you select is always the right table in your join\.

1. Select **Configure** to configure your join\. 

1. Give your joined dataset a name using the **Name** field\.

1. Select a **Join type**\.

1. Select a column from the left and right tables to join on\. 

1. Select **Apply** to preview the joined dataset on the right\. 

1. To add the joined table to your data flow, select **Add** in the top right corner\. 

## Concatenate Datasets<a name="data-wrangler-transform-concatenate"></a>

**Concatenate two datasets:**

1. Select **\+** next to the left dataframe that you want to concatenate\. The first dataframe you select is always the left table in your concatenate\. 

1. Select **Concatenate**\.

1. Select the right dataframe\. The second dataframe you select is always the right table in your concatenate\.

1. Select **Configure** to configure your concatenate\. 

1. Give your concatenated dataset a name using the **Name** field\.

1. \(Optional\) Select the check box next to **Remove duplicates after concatenation** to remove duplicate columns\. 

1. \(Optional\) Select the check box next to **Add column to indicate source dataframe** if, for each column in the new dataset, you want to add an indicator of the column's source\. 

1. Select **Apply** to preview the new dataset\. 

1. Select **Add** to add the new dataset to your data flow\. 

## Balance data<a name="data-wrangler-transform-balance-data"></a>

You can balance the data for datasets with an underrepresented category\. Balancing a dataset can help you create better models for binary classification\.

**Note**  
You can't balance datasets containing column vectors\.

You can use the **Balance data** operation to balance your data using one of the following operators:
+ Random oversampling – Randomly duplicates samples in the minority category\. For example, if you're trying to detect fraud, you might only have cases of fraud in 10% of your data\. For an equal proportion of fraudulent and non\-fraudulent cases, randomly duplicates fraud cases within the dataset 8 times\.
+ Random undersampling – Roughly equivalent to random oversampling\. Randomly removes samples from the overrepresented category to get the proportion of samples that you desire\.
+ Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique \(SMOTE\) – Uses samples from the underrepresented category to interpolate new synthetic minority samples\. For more information about SMOTE, see the following description\.

You can use all transforms for datasets containing both numeric and non\-numeric features\. SMOTE interpolates values by using neighboring samples\. Data Wrangler uses the R\-squared distance to determine the neighborhood to interpolate the additional samples\. Data Wrangler only uses numeric features to calculate the distances between samples in the underrepresented group\.

For two real samples in the underrepresented group, Data Wrangler interpolates the numeric features by using a weighted average\. It randomly assigns weights to those samples in the range of \[0, 1\]\. For numeric features, Data Wrangler interpolates samples using a weighted average of the samples\. For samples A and B, Data Wrangler could randomly assign a weight of 0\.7 to A and 0\.3 to B\. The interpolated sample has a value of 0\.7A \+ 0\.3B\.

Data Wrangler interpolates non\-numeric features by copying from either of the interpolated real samples\. It copies the samples with a probability that it randomly assigns to each sample\. For samples A and B, it can assign probabilities 0\.8 to A and 0\.2 to B\. For the probabilities it assigned, it copies A 80% of the time\.

## Custom Transforms<a name="data-wrangler-transform-custom"></a>

The **Custom Transforms** group allows you to use Pyspark, Pandas, or Pyspark \(SQL\) to define custom transformations\. For all three options, you use the variable `df` to access the dataframe to which you want to apply the transform\. You do not need to include a return statement\. Select **Preview** to preview the result of the custom transform\. Select **Add** to add the custom transform to your list of **Previous steps**\.

You can import the popular libraries with an `import` statement in the custom transform code block such as the following:
+ Numpy version 1\.19\.0
+ Scikit\-learn version 0\.23\.2
+ Scipy version 1\.5\.4
+ Pandas version 1\.0\.3
+ Pyspark version 3\.0\.0

If you include print statements in the code block, the result appears when you select **Preview**\.

The following are examples of how you can use the custom transforms code block:

**Pyspark**

The following example extracts date and time from a timestamp\.

```
from pyspark.sql.functions import from_unixtime, to_date, date_format
df = df.withColumn('DATE_TIME', from_unixtime('TIMESTAMP'))
df = df.withColumn( 'EVENT_DATE', to_date('DATE_TIME')).withColumn(
'EVENT_TIME', date_format('DATE_TIME', 'HH:mm:ss'))
```

**Pandas**

The following example provides an overview of the dataframe to which you are adding transforms\. 

```
df.info()
```

**Pyspark \(SQL\)**

The following creates a new dataframe with five columns: *name*, *fare*, *pclass*, *survived*\.

```
SELECT name, fare, pclass, survived FROM df
```

## Custom Formula<a name="data-wrangler-transform-custom-formula"></a>

Use **Custom formula** to define a new column using a Spark SQL expression to query data in the current dataframe\. The query must use the conventions of Spark SQL expressions\.

**Important**  
**Custom formula** does not support columns with spaces in the name\. You can use the **Rename column** transform in the **Manage columns** transform group to remove spaces from a column's name\. You can also add a **Pandas** **Custom transform** similar to the following to remove spaces from multiple columns in a single step\. This example changes columns named `A column` and `B column` to `A_column` and `B_column` respectively\.   

```
df.rename(columns={"A column": "A_column", "B column": "B_column"})
```

You can use this transform to perform operations on columns, referencing the columns by name\. For example, assuming the current dataframe contains columns named *col\_a* and *col\_b*, you can use the following operation to produce an **Output column** that is the product of these two columns with the following code:

```
col_a * col_b
```

Other common operations include the following, assuming a dataframe contains `col_a` and `col_b` columns:
+ Concatenate two columns: `concat(col_a, col_b)`
+ Add two columns: `col_a + col_b`
+ Subtract two columns: `col_a - col_b`
+ Divide two columns: `col_a / col_b`
+ Take the absolute value of a column: `abs(col_a)`

For more information, see the [Spark documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html?highlight=regex#pyspark.sql.DataFrame.selectExpr) on selecting data\. 

## Encode Categorical<a name="data-wrangler-transform-cat-encode"></a>

Categorical data is usually composed of a finite number of categories, where each category is represented with a string\. For example, if you have a table of customer data, a column that indicates the country a person lives in is categorical\. The categories would be Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, and so on\. Categorical data can be *nominal* or *ordinal*\. Ordinal categories have an inherent order, and nominal categories do not\. The highest degree obtained \(High school, Bachelors, Master\) is an example of ordinal categories\. 

Encoding categorical data is the process of creating a numerical representation for categories\. For example, if your categories are Dog and Cat, you may encode this information into two vectors, `[1,0]` to represent dog, and `[0,1]` to represent cat\.

When you encode ordinal categories, you may need to translate the natural order of categories into your encoding\. For example, you can represent highest degree obtained with the following map: `{"High school": 1, "Bachelors": 2, "Masters":3}`\.

Use categorical encoding to encode categorical data that is in string format into arrays of integers\. 

The Data Wrangler categorical encoders create encodings for all categories that exist in a column at the time the step is defined\. If new categories have been added to a column when you start a Data Wrangler job to process your dataset at time *t*, and this column was the input for a Data Wrangler categorical encoding transform at time *t*\-1, these new categories are considered *missing* in the Data Wrangler job\. The option you select for **Invalid handling strategy** is applied to these missing values\. Examples of when this can occur are: 
+ When you use a \.flow file to create a Data Wrangler job to process a dataset that was updated after the creation of the data flow\. For example, you may use a data flow to regularly process sales data each month\. If that sales data is updated weekly, new categories may be introduced into columns for which an encode categorical step is defined\. 
+ When you select **Sampling** when you import your dataset, some categories may be left out of the sample\. 

In these situations, these new categories are considered missing values in the Data Wrangler job\.

You can choose from and configure an *ordinal* and a *one\-hot encode*\. Use the following sections to learn more about these options\. 

Both transforms create a new column named **Output column name**\. You specify the output format of this column with **Output style**:
+ Select **Vector** to produce a single column with a sparse vector\. 
+ Select **Columns** to create a column for every category with an indicator variable for whether the text in the original column contains a value that is equal to that category\.

### Ordinal Encode<a name="data-wrangler-transform-cat-encode-ordinal"></a>

Select **Ordinal encode** to encode categories into an integer between 0 and the total number of categories in the **Input column** you select\.

**Invalid handing strategy**: Select a method to handle invalid or missing values\. 
+ Choose **Skip** if you want to omit the rows with missing values\.
+ Choose **Keep** to retain missing values as the last category\.
+ Choose **Error** if you want Data Wrangler to throw an error if missing values are encountered in the **Input column**\.
+ Choose **Replace with NaN** to replace missing with NaN\. This option is recommended if your ML algorithm can handle missing values\. Otherwise, the first three options in this list may produce better results\.

### One\-Hot Encode<a name="data-wrangler-transform-cat-encode-onehot"></a>

Select **One\-hot encode** for **Transform** to use one\-hot encoding\. Configure this transform using the following: 
+ **Drop last category**: If `True`, the last category does not have a corresponding index in the one\-hot encoding\. When missing values are possible, a missing category is always the last one and setting this to `True` means that a missing value results in an all zero vector\.
+ **Invalid handing strategy**: Select a method to handle invalid or missing values\. 
  + Choose **Skip** if you want to omit the rows with missing values\.
  + Choose **Keep** to retain missing values as the last category\.
  + Choose **Error** if you want Data Wrangler to throw an error if missing values are encountered in the **Input column**\.
+ **Is input ordinal encoded**: Select this option if the input vector contains ordinal encoded data\. This option requires that input data contain non\-negative integers\. If **True**, input *i* is encoded as a vector with a non\-zero in the *i*th location\. 

### Similarity encode<a name="data-wrangler-transform-cat-encode-similarity"></a>

Use similarity encoding when you have the following:
+ A large number of categorical variables
+ Noisy data

The similarity encoder creates embeddings for columns with categorical data\. An embedding is a mapping of discrete objects, such as words, to vectors of real numbers\. It encodes similar strings to vectors containing similar values\. For example, it creates very similar encodings for "California" and "Calfornia"\.

Data Wrangler converts each category in your dataset into a set of tokens using a 3\-gram tokenizer\. It converts the tokens into an embedding using min\-hash encoding\.

The following example shows how the similarity encoder creates vectors from strings\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/studio/mohave/destination-nodes/similarity-encode-example-screenshot-0.png)

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/studio/mohave/destination-nodes/similarity-encode-example-screenshot-1.png)

The similarity encodings that Data Wrangler creates:
+ Have low dimensionality
+ Are scalable to a large number of categories
+ Are robust and resistant to noise

For the preceding reasons, similarity encoding is more versatile than one\-hot encoding\.

To add the similarity encoding transform to your dataset, use the following procedure\.

To use similarity encoding, do the following\.

1. Sign in to the [Amazon SageMaker Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\.

1. Choose **Open Studio**\.

1. Choose **Launch app**\.

1. Choose **Studio**\.

1. Specify your data flow\.

1. Choose a step with a transformation\.

1. Choose **Add step**\.

1. Choose **Encode categorical**\.

1. Specify the following:
   + **Transform** – **Similarity encode**
   + **Input column** – The column containing the categorical data that you're encoding\.
   + **Target dimension** – Optional: The dimension of the categorical embedding vector\. The default value is 30\. We recommend using a larger target dimension if you have a large dataset with many categories\.
   + **Output style** – Choose **Vector** for a single vector with all of the encoded values\. Choose **Column** to have the encoded values in separate columns\.
   + **Output column** – Optional: The name of the output column for a vector encoded output\. For a column encoded output, the prefix of the column names followed by listed number\.

## Featurize Text<a name="data-wrangler-transform-featurize-text"></a>

Use the **Feature Text** transform group to inspect string typed columns and use text embedding to featurize these columns\. 

This feature group contains two features, *Character statistics* and *Vectorize*\. Use the following sections to learn more about these transforms\. For both options, the **Input column** must contain text data \(string type\)\.

### Character Statistics<a name="data-wrangler-transform-featurize-text-character-stats"></a>

Use **Character statistics** to generate statistics for each row in a column containing text data\. 

This transforms computes the following ratios and counts for each row, and creates a new column to report the result\. The new column is named using the input column name as a prefix and a suffix that is specific to the ratio or count\. 
+ Number of words: The total number of words in that row\. The suffix for this output column is **\-stats\_word\_count**\.
+ Number of characters: The total number of characters in that row\. The suffix for this output column is **\-stats\_char\_count**\.
+ Ratio of upper: The number of upper\-case characters, from A to Z, divided by all characters in the column\. The suffix for this output column is **\-stats\_capital\_ratio**\.
+ Ratio of lower: The number of lower\-case characters, from a to z, divided by all characters in the column\. The suffix for this output column is **\-stats\_lower\_ratio**\.
+ Ratio of digits: The ratio of digits in a single row over the sum of digits in the input column\. The suffix for this output column is **\-stats\_digit\_ratio**\.
+ Special characters ratio: The ratio of non\-alphanumeric \(characters like \#$&%:@\) characters to over the sum of all characters in the input column\. The suffix for this output column is **\-stats\_special\_ratio**\.

### Vectorize<a name="data-wrangler-transform-featurize-text-vectorize"></a>

Text embedding involves mapping words or phrases from a vocabulary to vectors of real numbers\. Use the Data Wrangler text embedding transform to tokenize and vectorize text data into term frequency–inverse document frequency \(TF\-IDF\) vectors\. 

When TF\-IDF is calculated for a column of text data, each word in each sentence is converted to a real number that represents its semantic importance\. Higher numbers are associated with less frequent words, which tend to be more meaningful\. 

When you define a **Vectorize** transform step, the count vectorizer and TF\-IDF methods are defined using data available in Data Wrangler when defining this step\. These same methods will be used when running a Data Wrangler job\.

You configure this transform using the following: 
+ **Output column name**: This transform will create a new column with the text embedding\. Use this field to specify a name for this output column\. 
+ **Tokenizer**: A tokenizer converts the sentence into a list of words, or *tokens*\. 

  Choose **Standard** to use a tokenizer that splits by white space and converts each word to lowercase\. For example, `"Good dog"` is tokenized to `["good","dog"]`\.

  Choose **Custom** to use a customized tokenizer\. If you choose **Custom**, you can use the following fields to configure the tokenizer:
  + **Minimum token length**: The minimum length, in characters, for a token to be valid\. Defaults to `1`\. For example, if you specify `3` for minimum token length, words like `a, at, in` are dropped from the tokenized sentence\. 
  + **Should regex split on gaps**: If selected, **regex** splits on gaps\. Otherwise, it matches tokens\. Defaults to `True`\. 
  + **Regex pattern**: Regex pattern that defines the tokenization process\. Defaults to `' \\ s+'`\.
  + **To lowercase**: If chosen, all characters are converted to lowercase before tokenization\. Defaults to `True`\.

  To learn more, refer to the Spark documentation on [Tokenizer](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0/ml-features#tokenizer)\.
+ **Vectorizer**: The vectorizer converts the list of tokens into a sparse numeric vector\. Each token corresponds to an index in the vector and a non\-zero indicates the existence of the token in the input sentence\. You can choose from two vectorizer options, *Count* and *Hashing*\.
  + **Count vectorize** allows customizations that filter infrequent or too common tokens\. **Count vectorize parameters** include the following: 
    + **Minimum term frequency**: In each row, terms \(tokens\) with smaller frequency are filtered\. If you specify an integer, this is an absolute threshold \(inclusive\)\. If you specify a fraction between 0 \(inclusive\) and 1, the threshold is relative to the total term count\. Defaults to `1`\.
    + **Minimum document frequency**: Minimum number of rows in which a term \(token\) must appear to be included\. If you specify an integer, this is an absolute threshold \(inclusive\)\. If you specify a fraction between 0 \(inclusive\) and 1, the threshold is relative to the total term count\. Defaults to `1`\.
    + **Maximum document frequency**: Maximum number of documents \(rows\) in which a term \(token\) can appear to be included\. If you specify an integer, this is an absolute threshold \(inclusive\)\. If you specify a fraction between 0 \(inclusive\) and 1, the threshold is relative to the total term count\. Defaults to `0.999`\.
    + **Maximum vocabulary size**: Maximum size of the vocabulary\. The vocabulary is made up of all terms \(tokens\) in all rows of the column\. Defaults to `262144`\.
    + **Binary outputs**: If selected, the vector outputs do not include the number of appearances of a term in a document, but rather are a binary indicator of its appearance\. Defaults to `False`\.

    To learn more about this option, refer to the Spark documentation on [CountVectorizer](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0/ml-features#countvectorizer)\.
  + **Hashing** is computationally faster\. **Hash vectorize parameters** includes the following:
    + **Number of features during hashing**: A hash vectorizer maps tokens to a vector index according to their hash value\. This feature determines the number of possible hash values\. Large values result in fewer collisions between hash values but a higher dimension output vector\.

    To learn more about this option, refer to the Spark documentation on [FeatureHasher](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0/ml-features#featurehasher)
+ **Apply IDF**: When chosen, an IDF transformation is applied, which multiplies the term frequency with the standard inverse document frequency used for TF\-IDF embedding\. **IDF parameters** include the following: 
  + **Minimum document frequency **: Minimum number of documents \(rows\) in which a term \(token\) must appear to be included\. If **count\_vectorize** is the chosen vectorizer, we recommend that you keep the default value and only modify the **min\_doc\_freq** field in **Count vectorize parameters**\. Defaults to `5`\.
+ ** Output format**:The output format of each row\. 
  + Select **Vector** to produce a single column with a sparse vector\. 
  + Select **Flattened** to create a column for every category with an indicator variable for whether the text in the original column contains a value that is equal to that category\. You can only choose flattened when **Vectorizer** is set as **Count vectorizer**\.

## Transform Time Series<a name="data-wrangler-transform-time-series"></a>

In Data Wrangler, you can transform time series data\. The values in a time series dataset are indexed to specific time\. For example, a dataset that shows the number of customers in a store for each hour in a day is a time series dataset\. The following table shows an example of a time series dataset\.


**Hourly Number of Customers in a Store**  

| Number of Customers | Time \(hour\) | 
| --- | --- | 
| 4 | 09:00 | 
| 10 | 10:00 | 
| 14 | 11:00 | 
| 25 | 12:00 | 
| 20 | 13:00 | 
| 18 | 14:00 | 

For the preceding table, the "Number of Customers" column contains the time series data\. The time series data is indexed on the hourly data in the "Time \(hour\)" column\.

You might need to perform a series of transformations on your data to get it in a format that you can use for your analysis\. Use the **Time series** transform group to transform your time series data\. For more information about the transformations that you can perform, see the following sections\.

### Group by a Time Series<a name="data-wrangler-group-by-time-series"></a>

You can use the group by operation to group time series data for specific values in a column\.

For example, if you had the following table that tracked the average daily electricity usage in a household:


**Average Daily Household Electricity Usage**  

| Household ID | Daily Time Stamp | Electricity Usage \(kWh\) | Number of Household Occupants | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| household\_0 | 1/1/2020 | 30 | 2 | 
| household\_0 | 1/2/2020 | 40 | 2 | 
| household\_0 | 1/4/2020 | 35 | 3 | 
| household\_1 | 1/2/2020 | 45 | 3 | 
| household\_1 | 1/3/2020 | 55 | 4 | 

If you choose to group by ID, you get the following table:


**Electricity Usage Grouped by Household ID**  

| Household ID | Electricity Usage Series \(kWh\) | Number of Household Occupants Series | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| household\_0 | \[30, 40, 35\] | \[2, 2, 3\] | 
| household\_1 | \[45, 55\] | \[3, 4\] | 

Each entry in the time series sequence is ordered by the time stamp corresponding\. The first element of the sequence corresponds to the first time stamp of the series\. For `household_0`, `30` is the first value of the Electricity Usage Series\. The value of `30` corresponds to the first time stamp of `1/1/2020`\.

You can include the starting time stamp and ending time stamp\. The following table shows an example of how that appears\.


**Electricity Usage Grouped by Household ID**  

| Household ID | Electricity Usage Series \(kWh\) | Number of Household Occupants Series | Start\_Time | End\_Time | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| household\_0 | \[30, 40, 35\] | \[2, 2, 3\] | 1/1/2020 | 1/4/2020 | 
| household\_1 | \[45, 55\] | \[3, 4\] | 1/2/2020 | 1/3/2020 | 

You can use the following procedure to group by a time series column\. 

1. Open your Data Wrangler data flow\.

1. If you haven't imported your dataset, import it under the **Import data** tab\.

1. In your data flow, under **Data types**, choose the **\+**, and select **Add transform**\.

1. Choose **Add step**\.

1. Choose **Time Series**\.

1. Under **Transform** choose **Groupby**\.

1. Specify a column in **Groupby this column**\.

1. For **Apply to columns**, specify a value\.

1. Choose **Preview** to generate a preview of the transform\.

1. Choose **Add** to add the transform to the Data Wrangler data flow\.

### Resample Time Series Data<a name="data-wrangler-resample-time-series"></a>

Time series data usually has observations that aren't taken at regular intervals\. For example, a dataset could have observations that are recorded hourly and other observations that are recorded every two hours\.

Many analyses, such as forecasting algorithms, require the observations to be taken at regular intervals\. Resampling gives you the ability to establish regular intervals for the observations in your dataset\.

You can either upsample or downsample a time series\. Downsampling increases the interval between observations in the dataset\. For example, if you downsample observations that are taken either every hour or every two hours, each observation in your dataset is taken every two hours\. The hourly observations are aggregated into a single value using an aggregation method such as the mean or median\.

Upsampling reduces the interval between observations in the dataset\. For example, if you upsample observations that are taken every two hours into hourly observations, you can use an interpolation method to infer hourly observations from the ones that have been taken every two hours\. For information on interpolation methods, see [pandas\.DataFrame\.interpolate](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.interpolate.html)\.

You can resample both numeric an non\-numeric data\.

Use the **Resample** operation to resample your time series data\. If you have multiple time series in your dataset, Data Wrangler standardizes the time interval for each time series\.

The following is an example of downsampling time series data by using the mean as the aggregation method\. The data is downsampled from every two hours to every hour\.


**Hourly Temperature Readings Over a Day Before Downsampling**  

| Time Stamp | Temperature \(Celsius\) | 
| --- | --- | 
| 12:00 | 30 | 
| 1:00 | 32 | 
| 2:00 | 35 | 
| 3:00 | 32 | 
| 4:00 | 30 | 


**Temperature Readings Downsampled to Every Two Hours**  

| Time Stamp | Temperature \(Celsius\) | 
| --- | --- | 
| 12:00 | 30 | 
| 2:00 | 33\.5 | 
| 2:00 | 35 | 
| 4:00 | 32\.5 | 

You can use the following procedure to resample time series data\.

1. Open your Data Wrangler data flow\.

1. If you haven't imported your dataset, import it under the **Import data** tab\.

1. In your data flow, under **Data types**, choose the **\+**, and select **Add transform**\.

1. Choose **Add step**\.

1. Choose **Resample**\.

1. For **Timestamp**, choose the time stamp column\.

1. For **Frequency unit**, specify the frequency that you'll be resampling\.

1. Optional: Specify a value for **Frequency quantity**\.

1. Configure the transform by specifying the remaining fields\.

1. Choose **Preview** to generate a preview of the transform\.

1. Choose **Add** to add the transform to the Data Wrangler data flow\.

### Handle Missing Time Series Data<a name="data-wrangler-transform-handle-missing-time-series"></a>

If you have missing values in your dataset, you can do one of the following:
+ For datasets that have multiple time series, drop the time series that have missing values that are greater than a threshold that you specify\.
+ Impute the missing values in a time series by using other values in the time series\.

Imputing a missing value involves replacing the data by either specifying a value or by using an inferential method\. The following are the methods that you can use for imputation:
+ Constant value – Replace all the missing data in your dataset with a value that you specify\.
+ Most common value – Replace all the missing data with the value that has the highest frequency in the dataset\.
+ Forward fill – Use a forward fill to replace the missing values with the non\-missing value that precedes the missing values\. For the sequence: \[2, 4, 7, NaN, NaN, NaN, 8\], all of the missing values are replaced with 7\. The sequence that results from using a forward fill is \[2, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8\]\.
+ Backward fill – Use a backward fill to replace the missing values with the non\-missing value that follows the missing values\. For the sequence: \[2, 4, 7, NaN, NaN, NaN, 8\], all of the missing values are replaced with 8\. The sequence that results from using a backward fill is \[2, 4, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8\]\. 
+ Interpolate – Uses an interpolation function to impute the missing values\. For more information on the functions that you can use for interpolation, see [pandas\.DataFrame\.interpolate](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.interpolate.html)\.

Some of the imputation methods might not be able to impute of all the missing value in your dataset\. For example, a **Forward fill** can't impute a missing value that appears at the beginning of the time series\. You can impute the values by using either a forward fill or a backward fill\.

You can either impute missing values within a cell or within a column\.

The following example shows how values are imputed within a cell\.


**Electricity Usage With Missing Values**  

| Household ID | Electricity Usage Series \(kWh\) | 
| --- | --- | 
| household\_0 | \[30, 40, 35, NaN, NaN\] | 
| household\_1 | \[45, NaN, 55\] | 


**Electricity Usage With Values Imputed Using a Forward Fill**  

| Household ID | Electricity Usage Series \(kWh\) | 
| --- | --- | 
| household\_0 | \[30, 40, 35, 35, 35\] | 
| household\_1 | \[45, 45, 55\] | 

The following example shows how values are imputed within a column\.


**Average Daily Household Electricity Usage With Missing Values**  

| Household ID | Electricity Usage \(kWh\) | 
| --- | --- | 
| household\_0 | 30 | 
| household\_0 | 40 | 
| household\_0 | NaN | 
| household\_1 | NaN | 
| household\_1 | NaN | 


**Average Daily Household Electricity Usage With Values Imputed Using a Forward Fill**  

| Household ID | Electricity Usage \(kWh\) | 
| --- | --- | 
| household\_0 | 30 | 
| household\_0 | 40 | 
| household\_0 | 40 | 
| household\_1 | 40 | 
| household\_1 | 40 | 

You can use the following procedure to handle missing values\.

1. Open your Data Wrangler data flow\.

1. If you haven't imported your dataset, import it under the **Import data** tab\.

1. In your data flow, under **Data types**, choose the **\+**, and select **Add transform**\.

1. Choose **Add step**\.

1. Choose **Handle missing**\.

1. For **Time series input type**, choose whether you want to handle missing values inside of a cell or along a column\.

1. For **Impute missing values for this column**, specify the column that has the missing values\.

1. For **Method for imputing values**, select a method\.

1. Configure the transform by specifying the remaining fields\.

1. Choose **Preview** to generate a preview of the transform\.

1. If you have missing values, you can specify a method for imputing them under **Method for imputing values**\.

1. Choose **Add** to add the transform to the Data Wrangler data flow\.

### Validate the Time Stamp of Your Time Series Data<a name="data-wrangler-transform-validate-timestamp"></a>

You might have time stamp data that is invalid\. You can use the **Validate time stamp** function to determine whether the timestamps in your dataset are valid\. Your timestamp can be invalid for one or more of the following reasons:
+ Your time stamp column has missing values\.
+ The values in your time stamp column are not formatted correctly\.

If you have invalid time stamps in your dataset, you won't be able to perform your analysis successfully\. You can use Data Wrangler to identify invalid time stamps and understand where you need to clean your data\.

The time series validation works in one of the two ways:

You can configure Data Wrangler to do one of the following if it encounters missing values in your dataset:
+ Drop the rows that have the missing or invalid values\.
+ Identify the rows that have the missing or invalid values\.
+ Throw an error if it finds any missing or invalid values in your dataset\.

You can validate the time stamps on columns that either have the `timestamp` type or the `string` type\. If the column has the `string` type, Data Wrangler converts the type of the column to `timestamp` and performs the validation\.

You can use the following procedure to validate the time stamps in your dataset\.

1. Open your Data Wrangler data flow\.

1. If you haven't imported your dataset, import it under the **Import data** tab\.

1. In your data flow, under **Data types**, choose the **\+**, and select **Add transform**\.

1. Choose **Add step**\.

1. Choose **Validate timestamps**\.

1. For **Timestamp Column**, choose the time stamp column\.

1. For **Policy**, choose whether you want to handle missing time stamps\.

1. Optional: For **Output column**, specify a name for the output column\.

1. If the date time column is formatted for the string type, choose **Cast to datetime**\.

1. Choose **Preview** to generate a preview of the transform\.

1. Choose **Add** to add the transform to the Data Wrangler data flow\.

### Standardizing the Length of the Time Series<a name="data-wrangler-transform-standardize-length"></a>

If you have time series data stored as arrays, you can standardize each time series to the same length\. Standardizing the length of the time series array might make it easier for you to perform your analysis on the data\.

You can standardize your time series for data transformations that requires the length of your data to be fixed\.

Many ML algorithms require you to flatten your time series data before you use them\. Flattening time series data is separating each value of the time series into its own column in a dataset\. The number of columns in a dataset can't change, so the lengths of the time series need to be standardized between you flatten each array into a set of features\.

Each time series is set to the length that you specify as a quantile or percentile of the time series set\. For example, you can have three sequences that have the following lengths:
+ 3
+ 4
+ 5

You can set the length of all of the sequences as the length of the sequence that has the 50th percentile length\.

Time series arrays that are shorter than the length you've specified have missing values added\. The following is an example format of standardizing the time series to a longer length: \[2, 4, 5, NaN, NaN, NaN\]\.

You can use different approaches to handle the missing values\. For information on those approaches, see [Handle Missing Time Series Data](#data-wrangler-transform-handle-missing-time-series)\.

The time series arrays that are longer than the length that you specify are truncated\.

You can use the following procedure to standardize the length of the time series\.

1. Open your Data Wrangler data flow\.

1. If you haven't imported your dataset, import it under the **Import data** tab\.

1. In your data flow, under **Data types**, choose the **\+**, and select **Add transform**\.

1. Choose **Add step**\.

1. Choose **Standardize length**\.

1. For **Standardize the time series length for the column**, choose a column\.

1. Optional: For **Output column**, specify a name for the output column\. If you don't specify a name, the transform is done in place\.

1. If the date time column is formatted for the string type, choose **Cast to datetime**\.

1. Choose **Cutoff quantile**, specify a quantile to set the length of the sequence\.

1. Choose **Flatten the output** to output the values of the time series into separate columns\.

1. Choose **Preview** to generate a preview of the transform\.

1. Choose **Add** to add the transform to the Data Wrangler data flow\.

### Extract Features from Your Time Series Data<a name="data-wrangler-transform-extract-time-series-features"></a>

If you're running a classification or a regression algorithm on your time series data, we recommend extracting features from the time series before running the algorithm\. Extracting features might improve the performance of your algorithm\.

Use the following options to choose how you want to extract features from your data:
+ Use **Minimal subset** to specify extracting 8 features that you know are useful in downstream analyses\. You can use a minimal subset when you need to perform computations quickly\. You can also use it when your ML algorithm has a high risk of overfitting and you want to provide it with fewer features\.
+ Use **Efficient subset** to specify extracting the most features possible without extracting features that are computationally intensive in your analyses\.
+ Use **All features** to specify extracting all features from the tune series\.
+ Use **Manual subset** to choose a list of features that you think explain the variation in your data well\.

Use the following the procedure to extract features from your time series data\.

1. Open your Data Wrangler data flow\.

1. If you haven't imported your dataset, import it under the **Import data** tab\.

1. In your data flow, under **Data types**, choose the **\+**, and select **Add transform**\.

1. For **Strategy**, choose a strategy to extract the features\.

1. Choose **Preview** to generate a preview of the transform\.

1. Choose **Add** to add the transform to the Data Wrangler data flow\.

### Use Lagged Features from Your Time Series Data<a name="data-wrangler-transform-lag-time-series"></a>

For many use cases, the best way to predict the future behavior of your time series is to use its most recent behavior\.

The most common uses of lagged features are the following:
+ Collecting a handful of past values\. For example, for time, t \+ 1, you collect t, t \- 1, t \- 2, and t \- 3\.
+ Collecting values that correspond to seasonal behavior in the data\. For example, to predict the occupancy in a restaurant at 1:00pm, you might want to use the features from 1:00pm on the previous day\. Using the features from 12:00pm or 11:00am on the same day might not be as predictive as using the features from previous days\.

1. Open your Data Wrangler data flow\.

1. If you haven't imported your dataset, import it under the **Import data** tab\.

1. In your data flow, under **Data types**, choose the **\+**, and select **Add transform**\.

   + **Include the entire lag window**
   + **Flatten the output**
   + **Drop rows without history**

1. Choose **Preview** to generate a preview of the transform\.

1. Choose **Add** to add the transform to the Data Wrangler data flow\.

### Create a Datetime Range In Your Time Series<a name="data-wrangler-transform-datetime-range"></a>

You might have time series data that don't have time stamps\. If you know that the observations were taken at regular intervals, you can generate time stamps for the time series in a separate column\. To generate time stamps, you specify the value for the start time stamp and the frequency of the time stamps\.

For example, you might have the following time series data for the number of customers at a restaurant\.


**Time Series Data on the Number of Customers at a Restaurant**  

| Number of Customers | 
| --- | 
| 10 | 
| 14 | 
| 24 | 
| 40 | 
| 30 | 
| 20 | 

If you know that the restaurant opened at 5:00pm and that the observations are taken hourly, you can add a time stamp column that corresponds to the time series data\. You can see the time stamp column in the following table\.


**Time Series Data on the Number of Customers at a Restaurant**  

| Number of Customers | Time Stamp | 
| --- | --- | 
| 10 | 1:00 pm | 
| 14 | 2:00 pm | 
| 24 | 3:00 pm | 
| 40 | 4:00 pm | 
| 30 | 5:00 pm | 
| 20 | 6:00 pm | 

Use the following procedure to add a datetime range to your data\.

1. For **Frequency type**, choose the unit used to measure the frequency of the time stamps\.

1. For **Starting timestamp**, specify the start time stamp\.

1. For **Output column**, specify a name for the output column\.

1. Optional: Configure the output using the remaining fields\.

1. Choose **Preview** to generate a preview of the transform\.

1. Choose **Add** to add the transform to the Data Wrangler data flow\.

### Use a Rolling Window In Your Time Series<a name="data-wrangler-transform-rolling-window"></a>

You can extract features over a time period\. For example, for time, t, and a time window length of 3, and for the row that indicates the tth time stamp, we append the features that are extracted from the time series at times t \- 3, t \-2, and t \- 1\. For information on extracting features, see [Extract Features from Your Time Series Data](#data-wrangler-transform-extract-time-series-features)\. 

You can use the following procedure to extract features over a time period\.

1. Open your Data Wrangler data flow\.

## Featurize Date/Time<a name="data-wrangler-transform-datetime-embed"></a>

Use **Featurize date/time** to create a vector embedding representing a date/time field\. To use this transform, your date/time data must be in one of the following formats: 
+ Strings describing date/time, for example, `"January 1st, 2020, 12:44pm"`\. 
+ A unix timestamp\. A unix timestamp describes the number of seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds from 1/1/1970\. 

You can choose to **Infer datetime format** and provide a **Datetime format**\. If you provide a date/time format, you must use the codes described in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes)\. The options you select for these two configurations have implications for the speed of the operation, and the final results:
+ The most manual and computationally fastest option is to specify a **Datetime format** and select **No** for **Infer datetime format**\.
+ To reduce manual labor, you can choose **Infer datetime format** and not specify a date/time format\. It is also a computationally fast operation; however, the first date/time format encountered in the input column is assumed to be the format for the entire column\. If there are other formats in the column, these values are NaN in the final output\. Inferring the date/time format can give you unparsed strings\. 
+ If you don't specify a format and select **No** for **Infer datetime format**, you get the most robust results\. All the valid date/time strings are parsed\. However, this operation can be an order of magnitude slower than the first two options in this list\. 

When you use this transform, you specify an **Input column** which contains date/time data in one of the formats listed above\. The transform creates an output column named **Output column name**\. The format of the output column depends on your configuration using the following:
+ **Vector**: Outputs a single column as a vector\. 
+ **Columns**: Creates a new column for every feature\. For example, if the output contains a year, month, and day, three separate columns are created for year, month, and day\. 

Additionally, you must choose an **Embedding mode**\. For linear models and deep networks, we recommend choosing **cyclic**\. For tree based algorithms, we recommend choosing **ordinal**\.

## Format String<a name="data-wrangler-transform-format-string"></a>

The **Format string** transforms contain standard string formatting operations\. For example, you can use these operations to remove special characters, normalize string lengths, and update string casing\.

This feature group contains the following transforms\. All transforms return copies of the strings in the **Input column** and add the result to a new, output column\.


****  

| Name | Function | 
| --- | --- | 
| Left pad |  Left\-pad the string with a given **Fill character** to the given **width**\. If the string is longer than **width**, the return value is shortened to **width** characters\.  | 
| Right pad |  Right\-pad the string with a given **Fill character** to the given **width**\. If the string is longer than **width**, the return value is shortened to **width** characters\.  | 
| Center \(pad on either side\) |  Center\-pad the string \(add padding on both sides of the string\) with a given **Fill character** to the given **width**\. If the string is longer than **width**, the return value is shortened to **width** characters\.  | 
| Prepend zeros |  Left\-fill a numeric string with zeros, up to a given **width**\. If the string is longer than **width**, the return value is shortened to **width** characters\.  | 
| Strip left and right |  Returns a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed\.  | 
| Strip characters from left |  Returns a copy of the string with leading characters removed\.  | 
| Strip characters from right |  Returns a copy of the string with trailing characters removed\.  | 
| Lower case |  Convert all letters in text to lowercase\.  | 
| Upper case |  Convert all letters in text to uppercase\.  | 
| Capitalize |  Capitalize the first letter in each sentence\.   | 
| Swap case | Converts all uppercase characters to lowercase and all lowercase characters to uppercase characters of the given string, and returns it\. | 
| Add prefix or suffix |  Adds a prefix and a suffix the string column\. You must specify at least one of **Prefix** and **Suffix**\.   | 
| Remove Symbols |  Removes given symbols from a string\. All listed characters will be removed\. Defaults to white space\.   | 

## Handle Outliers<a name="data-wrangler-transform-handle-outlier"></a>

Machine learning models are sensitive to the distribution and range of your feature values\. Outliers, or rare values, can negatively impact model accuracy and lead to longer training times\. Use this feature group to detect and update outliers in your dataset\. 

When you define a **Handle outliers** transform step, the statistics used to detect outliers are generated on the data available in Data Wrangler when defining this step\. These same statistics are used when running a Data Wrangler job\. 

Use the following sections to learn more about the transforms this group contains\. You specify an **Output name** and each of these transforms produces an output column with the resulting data\. 

### Robust standard deviation numeric outliers<a name="data-wrangler-transform-handle-outlier-rstdev"></a>

This transform detects and fixes outliers in numeric features using statistics that are robust to outliers\.

You must define an **Upper quantile** and a **Lower quantile**, which are used in the statistics used to calculate outliers\. You also need to specify the number of **Standard deviations** from which a value must vary from the mean to be considered an outlier\. For example, if you specify 3 for **Standard deviations**, a value must fall more than 3 standard deviations from the mean to be considered an outlier\. 

The **Fix method** is the method used to handle outliers when they are detected\. You can choose from the following:
+ **Clip**: Use this option to clip the outliers to the corresponding outlier detection bound\.
+ **Remove**: Use this to remove rows with outliers from the dataframe\.
+ **Invalidate**: Use this to replace outliers with invalid values\.

### Standard Deviation Numeric Outliers<a name="data-wrangler-transform-handle-outlier-sstdev"></a>

This transform detects and fixes outliers in numeric features using the mean and standard deviation\.

You specify the number of **Standard deviations** a value must vary from the mean to be considered an outlier\. For example, if you specify 3 for **Standard deviations**, a value must fall more than 3 standard deviations from the mean to be considered an outlier\. 

The **Fix method** is the method used to handle outliers when they are detected\. You can choose from the following:
+ **Clip**: Use this option to clip the outliers to the corresponding outlier detection bound\.
+ **Remove**: Use this to remove rows with outliers from the dataframe\.
+ **Invalidate**: Use this to replace outliers with invalid values\.

### Quantile Numeric Outliers<a name="data-wrangler-transform-handle-outlier-quantile-numeric"></a>

Use this transform to detect and fix outliers in numeric features using quantiles\. You can define an **Upper quantile** and a **Lower quantile**, and all values that fall above or below those quantile\-values, respectively, are considered outliers\. 

The **Fix method** is the method used to handle outliers when they are detected\. You can choose from the following:
+ **Clip**: Use this option to clip the outliers to the corresponding outlier detection bound\.
+ **Remove**: Use this to remove rows with outliers from the dataframe\.
+ **Invalidate**: Use this to replace outliers with invalid values\. 

### Min\-Max Numeric Outliers<a name="data-wrangler-transform-handle-outlier-minmax-numeric"></a>

This transform detects and fixes outliers in numeric features using upper and lower thresholds\. Use this method if you know threshold values that demark outliers\.

You specify a **Upper threshold** and a **Lower threshold**, and if values fall above or below those thresholds respectively, they are considered outliers\. 

The **Fix method** is the method used to handle outliers when they are detected\. You can choose from the following:
+ **Clip**: Use this option to clip the outliers to the corresponding outlier detection bound\.
+ **Remove**: Use this to remove rows with outliers from the dataframe\.
+ **Invalidate**: Use this to replace outliers with invalid values\. 

### Replace Rare<a name="data-wrangler-transform-handle-outlier-replace-rare"></a>

When you use the **Replace rare** transform, you specify a threshold and Data Wrangler finds all values that meet that threshold and replaces them with a string that you specify\. For example, you may want to use this transform to categorize all outliers in a column into an "Others" category\. 
+ **Replacement string**: The string with which to replace outliers\.
+ **Absolute threshold**: A category is rare if the number of instances is less than or equal to this absolute threshold\.
+ **Fraction threshold**: A category is rare if the number of instances is less than or equal to this fraction threshold multiplied by the number of rows\.
+ **Max common categories**: Maximum not\-rare categories that remain after the operation\. If the threshold does not filter enough categories, those with the top number of appearances are classified as not rare\. If set to 0 \(default\), there is no hard limit to the number of categories\.

## Handle Missing Values<a name="data-wrangler-transform-handle-missing"></a>

Missing values are a common occurrence in machine learning datasets\. In some situations, it is appropriate to impute missing data with a calculated value, such as an average or categorically common value\. You can process missing values using the **Handle missing values** transform group\. This group contains the following transforms\. 

### Fill Missing<a name="data-wrangler-transform-fill-missing"></a>

Use the **Fill missing** transform to replace missing values with a **Fill value** you define\. 

### Impute Missing<a name="data-wrangler-transform-impute"></a>

Use the **Impute missing** transform to create a new column that contains imputed values where missing values were found in input categorical and numerical data\. The configuration depends on your data type\.

For numeric data, choose an imputing strategy, the strategy used to determine the new value to impute\. You can choose to impute the mean or the median over the values that are present in your dataset\. Data Wrangler uses the value that it computes to impute the missing values\.

For categorical data, Data Wrangler imputes missing values using the most frequent value in the column\. To impute a custom string, use the **Fill missing** transform instead\.

### Add Indicator for Missing<a name="data-wrangler-transform-missing-add-indicator"></a>

Use the **Add indicator for missing** transform to create a new indicator column, which contains a boolean `"false"` if a row contains a value, and `"true"` if a row contains a missing value\. 

### Drop Missing<a name="data-wrangler-transform-drop-missing"></a>

Use the **Drop missing** option to drop rows that contain missing values from the **Input column**\.

## Manage Columns<a name="data-wrangler-manage-columns"></a>

You can use the following transforms to quickly update and manage columns in your dataset: 


****  

| Name | Function | 
| --- | --- | 
| Drop Column | Delete a column\.  | 
| Duplicate Column | Duplicate a column\. | 
| Rename Column | Rename a column\. | 
| Move Column |  Move a column's location in the dataset\. Choose to move your column to the start or end of the dataset, before or after a reference column, or to a specific index\.   | 

## Manage Rows<a name="data-wrangler-transform-manage-rows"></a>

Use this transform group to quickly perform sort and shuffle operations on rows\. This group contains the following:
+ **Sort**: Sort the entire dataframe by a given column\. Select the check box next to **Ascending order** for this option; otherwise, deselect the check box and descending order is used for the sort\. 
+ **Shuffle**: Randomly shuffle all rows in the dataset\. 

## Manage Vectors<a name="data-wrangler-transform-manage-vectors"></a>

Use this transform group to combine or flatten vector columns\. This group contains the following transforms\. 
+ **Assemble**: Use this transform to combine Spark vectors and numeric data into a single column\. For example, you can combine three columns: two containing numeric data and one containing vectors\. Add all the columns you want to combine in **Input columns** and specify a **Output column name** for the combined data\. 
+ **Flatten**: Use this transform to flatten a single column containing vector data\. The input column must contain PySpark vectors, or array\-like objects\. You can control the number of columns that get created by specifying a **Method to detect number of outputs**\. For example, if you select **Length of first vector**, the number of elements in the first valid vector or array found in the column determines the number of output columns that gets created\. All other input vectors with too many items are truncated\. Inputs with too few items are filled with NaNs\.

  You also specify an **Output prefix**, which is used as the prefix for each output column\. 

## Process Numeric<a name="data-wrangler-transform-process-numeric"></a>

Use the **Process Numeric** feature group to process numeric data\. Each scalar in this group is defined using the Spark library\. The following scalars are supported:
+ **Standard Scaler**: Standardize the input column by subtracting the mean from each value and scaling to unit variance\. To learn more, refer to the Spark documentation for [StandardScaler](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0/ml-features#standardscaler)\.
+ **Robust Scaler**: Scale the input column using statistics that are robust to outliers\. To learn more, refer to the Spark documentation for [RobustScaler](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0/ml-features#robustscaler)\.
+ **Min Max Scaler**: Transform the input column by scaling each feature to a given range\. To learn more, refer to the Spark documentation for [MinMaxScaler](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0/ml-features#minmaxscaler)\.
+ **Max Absolute Scaler**: Scale the input column by dividing each value by the maximum absolute value\. To learn more, refer to the Spark documentation for [MaxAbsScaler](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0/ml-features#maxabsscaler)\.

## Search and Edit<a name="data-wrangler-transform-search-edit"></a>

Use this section to search for and edit specific patterns within strings\. For example, you can find and update strings within sentences or documents, split strings by delimiters, and find occurrences of specific strings\. 

The following transforms are supported under **Search and edit**\. All transforms return copies of the strings in the **Input column** and add the result to a new output column\.


****  

| Name | Function |

## Parse Value as Type<a name="data-wrangler-transform-cast-type"></a>

Use this transform to cast a column to a new type\. The supported Data Wrangler data types are:
+ Long
+ Float
+ Boolean
+ Date, in the format dd\-MM\-yyyy, representing day, month, and year respectively\. 
+ String

## Validate String<a name="data-wrangler-transform-validate-string"></a>

Use the **Validate string** transforms to create a new column that indicates that a row of text data meets a specified condition\. For example, you can use a **Validate string** transform to verify that a string only contains lowercase characters\. The following transforms are supported under **Validate string**\. 

The following transforms are included in this transform group\. If a transform outputs a Boolean value, `True` is represented with a `1` and `False` is represented with a `0`\.


****  

| Name | Function | 
| --- | --- | 
|  String length  |  Returns `True` if a string length equals specified length\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.   | 
|  Starts with  |  Returns `True` if a string starts will a specified prefix\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.  | 
|  Ends with  |  Returns `True` if a string length equals specified length\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.  | 
|  Is alphanumeric  |  Returns `True` if a string only contains numbers and letters\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.  | 
|  Is alpha \(letters\)  |  Returns `True` if a string only contains letters\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.  | 
|  Is digit  |  Returns `True` if a string only contains digits\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.  | 
|  Is space  |  Returns `True` if a string only contains numbers and letters\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.  | 
|  Is title  |  Returns `True` if a string contains any white spaces\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.  | 
|  Is lowercase  |  Returns `True` if a string only contains lower case letters\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.  | 
|  Is uppercase  |  Returns `True` if a string only contains upper case letters\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.  | 
|  Is numeric  |  Returns `True` if a string only contains numbers\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.  | 
|  Is decimal  |  Returns `True` if a string only contains decimal numbers\. Otherwise, returns `False`\.  | 

## Unnest JSON data<a name="data-wrangler-transform-flatten-column"></a>

If you have a \.csv file, you might values in your dataset that are JSON strings\. Similarly, you might have nested data in columns of either a Parquet file or a JSON document\.

Use the **Flatten structured** operator to separate the first level keys into separate columns\. A first level key is a key that isn't nested within a value\.

For example, you might have a dataset that has a *person* column with demographic information on each person stored as JSON strings\. A JSON string might look like the following\.

```
 "{"seq": 1,"name": {"first": "Nathaniel","last": "Ferguson"},"age": 59,"city": "Posbotno","state": "WV"}"
```

The **Flatten structured** operator converts the following first level keys into additional columns in your dataset:
+ seq
+ name
+ age
+ city
+ state

Data Wrangler puts the values of the keys as values under the columns\. The following shows the column names and values of the JSON\.

```
seq, name,                                    age, city, state
1, {"first": "Nathaniel","last": "Ferguson"}, 59, Posbotno, WV
```

For each value in your dataset containing JSON, the **Flatten structured** operator creates columns for the first\-level keys\. To create columns for nested keys, call the operator again\. For the preceding example, calling the operator creates the columns:
+ name\_first
+ name\_last

The following example shows the dataset that results from calling the operation again\.

```
seq, name,                                    age, city, state, name_first, name_last
1, {"first": "Nathaniel","last": "Ferguson"}, 59, Posbotno, WV, Nathaniel, Ferguson
```

Choose **Keys to flatten on** to specify the first\-level keys that want to extract as separate columns\. If you don't specify any keys, Data Wrangler extracts all the keys by default\.

## Explode array<a name="data-wrangler-transform-explode-array"></a>

Use **Explode array** to expand the values of the array into separate output rows\. For example, the operation can take each value in the array, \[\[1, 2, 3,\], \[4, 5, 6\], \[7, 8, 9\]\] and create a new column with the following rows:

```
                [1, 2, 3]
                [4, 5, 6]
                [7, 8, 9]
```

Data Wrangler names the new column, input\_column\_name\_flatten\.

You can call the **Explode array** operation multiple times to get the nested values of the array into separate output columns\. The following example shows the result of calling the operation multiple times on dataset with a nested array\.
