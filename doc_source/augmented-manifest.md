# Provide Dataset Metadata to Training Jobs with an Augmented Manifest File<a name="augmented-manifest"></a>

To classify data into different groupings, you train a model by using a dataset and metadata that act as labels\. To include metadata with your dataset in a training job, use an augmented manifest file\. When using an augmented manifest file, your dataset must be stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) and you must configure your training job to use dataset stored there\. You specify the location and format of this dataset for one or more [channels](sagemaker/latest/dg/API_Channel.html)\.

When specifying a channel's parameters, you specify a path to the file, called a `S3Uri`\. Amazon SageMaker interprets this URI based on the specified [S3DataType](sagemaker/latest/dg/API_S3DataSource.html#SageMaker-Type-S3DataSource-S3DataType)\. The `AugmentedManifestFile` option defines a manifest format that includes metadata with the input data\. Using an augmented manifest file is an alternative to preprocessing when you have labeled data\. For training jobs using labeled date, you typically need to preprocess the dataset to combine input data with metadata before training\. If your training dataset is large, preprocessing can be time consuming and expensive\.

## Augmented Manifest File Format<a name="augmented-manifest-format"></a>

An augmented manifest file must be formatted in [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) format\. In JSON Lines format, each line in the file is a complete JSON object followed by a newline separator\.

During training, Amazon SageMaker parses each JSON line and sends some or all of its attributes on to the training algorithm\. You specify which attribute contents to pass and the order in which to pass them with the `AttributeNames` parameter of the [CreateTrainingJob](API_CreateTrainingJob.md) API\. The `AttributeNames` parameter is an ordered list of attribute names that Amazon SageMaker looks for in the JSON object to use as training input\.

For example, if you list `["line", "book"]` for `AttributeNames`, the input data must include the attribute names of `line` and `book` in the specified order\. For this example, the following augmented manifest file content is valid:

```
{"author": "Herman Melville", "line": "Call me Ishmael", "book": "Moby Dick"}
{"line": "It was love at first sight.", "author": "Joseph Heller", "book": "Catch-22"}
```

Amazon SageMaker ignores unlisted attribute names even if they precede, follow, or are in between listed attributes\.

When using augmented manifest files, observe the following guidelines:
+ The order of the attributes listed in the `AttributeNames` parameter determines the order of the attributes passed to the algorithm in the training job\.
+ The listed `AttributeNames` can be a subset of all of the attributes in the JSON line\. Amazon SageMaker ignores unlisted attributes in the file\.
+ You can specify any type of data allowed by the JSON format in `AttributeNames`, including text, numerical, data arrays, or objects\.
+ To include an S3 URI as an attribute name, add the suffix `-ref` to it\.

If an attribute name contains the suffix `-ref`, the attribute's value must be an S3 URI to a data file that is accessible to the training job\. For example, if `AttributeNames` contains `["image-ref", "is-a-cat"]`, a valid augmented manifest file might contain these lines:

```
{"image-ref": "s3://mybucket/sample01/image1.jpg", "is-a-cat": 1}
{"image-ref": "s3://mybucket/sample02/image2.jpg", "is-a-cat": 0}
```

For the first line of this manifest, Amazon SageMaker retrieves the contents of the S3 object `s3://mybucket/foo/image1.jpg` and streams it to the algorithm for training\. The second line is the string representation of the `is-a-cat` attribute `"1"`, which is followed by the contents of the second line\.

## Stream Augmented Manifest File Data<a name="augmented-manifest-stream"></a>

Augmented manifest files are supported only for channels using Pipe input mode\. For each channel, the data is extracted from its augmented manifest file and streamed \(in order\) to the algorithm through the channel's named pipe\. Pipe mode uses the first in first out \(FIFO\) method, so records are processed in the order in which they are queued\. For information about Pipe input mode, see [InputMode](sagemaker/latest/dg/API_Channel.html#SageMaker-Type-Channel-InputMode)\.

Attribute names with a `"-ref"` suffix point to preformatted binary data\. In some cases, the algorithm knows how to parse the data\. In other cases, you might need to wrap the data so that records are delimited for the algorithm\. If the algorithm is compatible with [RecordIO\-formatted data](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/architecture/note_data_loading.html#data-format), specifying `RecordIO` for `RecordWrapperType` solves this issue\. If the algorithm is not compatible with `RecordIO` format, specify `None` for `RecordWrapperType` and make sure that your data is parsed correctly for your algorithm\. Using the `["image-ref", "is-a-cat"]` example, if you use RecordIO wrapping, the following stream of data is sent to the queue:

`recordio_formatted(s3://mybucket/foo/image1.jpg)recordio_formatted("1")recordio_formatted(s3://mybucket/bar/image2.jpg)recordio_formatted("0")`

Images that aren't wrapped with RecordIO format, are streamed with the corresponding `is-a-cat` attribute value as one record\. This can cause a problem because the algorithm might not delimit the images and attributes correctly\.

For more information about Pipe mode and how to use it, see [Using Your Own Training Algorithms \- Input Data Configuration](sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-training-algo.html#your-algorithms-training-algo-running-container-inputdataconfig)\.

## Use an Augmented Manifest File \(Console\)<a name="augmented-manifest-console"></a>

To complete this procedure, you need:
+ The URL of the S3 bucket where you've stored the augmented manifest file\.
+ To store the data that is listed in the augmented manifest file in an S3 bucket\.
+ The URL of the S3 bucket where you want to store the output of the job\.

**To use an augmented manifest file in a training job \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon SageMaker console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/sagemaker](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Training**, then choose **Training jobs**\. 

1. Choose **Create training job**\.

1. Provide a name for the training job\. The name must be unique within an AWS Region in an AWS account\. It can have 1 to 63 characters\. Valid characters: a\-z, A\-Z, 0\-9, and \. : \+ = @ \_ % \- \(hyphen\)\.

1. Choose the algorithm that you want to use\. For information about algorithms, see [Use Amazon SageMaker Built\-in Algorithms ](algos.md)\. If you want to use a custom algorithm, make sure that it is compatible with Pipe mode\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Resource configuration**, either accept the default values or, to reduce computation time, increase the resource consumption\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **Instance type**, choose the ML compute instance type that you want to use\. In most cases, **ml\.m4\.xlarge** is sufficient\. 

   1. For **Instance count**, use the default, `1`\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **Additional volume per instance \(GB\)**, choose the size of the ML storage volume that you want to provision\. In most cases, you can use the default, `1`\. If you are using a large dataset, use a larger size\.

1. Provide information about the input data for the training dataset\.

   1. For **Channel name**, either accept the default \(**train**\) or enter a more meaningful name, such as **training\-augmented\-manifest\-file**\.

   1. For **InputMode**, choose **Pipe**\.

   1. For **S3 data distribution type**, choose **FullyReplicated**\. When training incrementally, fully replicating causes each ML compute instance to use a complete copy of the expanded dataset\. For neural\-based algorithms, such as [Neural Topic Model \(NTM\) Algorithm](ntm.md), choose `ShardedByS3Key`\.

   1. If the data specified in the augmented manifest file is uncompressed, set the **Compression type** to **None**\. If the data is compressed using gzip, set it to **Gzip**\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **Content type**, specify the appropriate MIME type\. Content type is the multipurpose internet mail extension \(MIME\) type of the data\.

   1. For **Record wrapper**, if the dataset specified in the augmented manifest file is saved in RecordIO format, choose **RecordIO**\. If your dataset is not saved as a RecordIO\-formatted file, choose **None**\.

   1. For **S3 data type**, choose **AugmentedManifestFile**\.

   1. For **S3 location**, provide the path to the bucket where you stored the augmented manifest file\.

   1. For **AugmentedManifestFile attribute names**, specify the name of an attribute that you want to use\. The attribute name must be present within the augmented manifest file, and is case\-sensitive\.

   1. \(Optional\) To add more attribute names, choose **Add row** and specify another attribute name for each attribute\.

   1. \(Optional\) To adjust the order of attribute names, choose the up or down buttons next to the names\. When using an augmented manifest file, the order of the specified attribute names is important\.

   1. Choose **Done**\.

1. For **Output data configuration**, provide the following information:

   1. For **S3 location**, type the path to the S3 bucket where you want to store the output data\.

   1. \(Optional\) You can use your AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) encryption key to encrypt the output data at rest\. For **Encryption key**, provide the key ID or its Amazon Resource Number \(ARN\)\. For more information, see [KMS\-Managed Encryption Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html)\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Tags**, add one or more tags to the training job\. A *tag* is metadata that you can define and assign to AWS resources\. In this case, you can use tags to help you manage your training jobs\. A tag consists of a key and a value, which you define\. For example, you might want to create a tag with **Project** as a key and a value that refers to a project that is related to the training job, such as **Home value forecasts**\.

1. Choose **Create training job**\. Amazon SageMaker creates and runs the training job\.

After the training job has finished, Amazon SageMaker stores the model artifacts in the bucket whose path you provided for **S3 output path** in the **Output data configuration** field\. To deploy the model to get predictions, see [Step 2\.4: Deploy the Model to Amazon SageMaker](ex1-model-deployment.md)\.

The following shows how to train a model with an augmented manifest file using the Amazon SageMaker high\-level Python library:

```
# Create a model object set to using "Pipe" mode.
model = sagemaker.estimator.Estimator(training_image,
                                      role,
                                      train_instance_count=1,
                                      train_instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge',
                                      train_volume_size = 50,
                                      train_max_run = 360000,
                                      input_mode = 'Pipe',

                                      sagemaker_session=session)

# Create a train data channel with S3_data_type as 'AugmentedManifestFile' and attribute names.
train_data = sagemaker.session.s3_input(your_augmented_manifest_file,
                                        distribution='FullyReplicated',
