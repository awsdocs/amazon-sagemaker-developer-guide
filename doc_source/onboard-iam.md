# Onboard to Amazon SageMaker Studio Using IAM<a name="onboard-iam"></a>

This topic describes how to onboard to Amazon SageMaker Studio using the standard setup procedure for AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) authentication\. To onboard faster using IAM, see [Onboard Using Quick Start](onboard-quick-start.md)\.

For information on how to onboard using AWS Single Sign\-On \(AWS SSO\), see [Onboard Using SSO](onboard-sso-users.md)\.

**To onboard to Studio using IAM**

1. Open the [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\.

1. Choose **Amazon SageMaker Studio** at the top left of the page\.

1. On the **SageMaker Studio** page, under **Get started**, choose **Standard setup**\.

1. For **Authentication method**, choose **AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)**\.

1. Under **Permission**, for **Execution role for all users**, choose an option from the role selector\.

   If you choose **Enter a custom IAM role ARN**, the role must have at a minimum, an attached trust policy that grants SageMaker permission to assume the role\. For more information, see [SageMaker Roles](sagemaker-roles.md)\.

   If you choose **Create a new role**, the **Create an IAM role** dialog opens:

   1. For **S3 buckets you specify**, specify additional S3 buckets that users of your notebooks can access\. If you don't want to add access to more buckets, choose **None**\.

   1. Choose **Create role**\. SageMaker creates a new IAM `AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionPolicy` role with the [AmazonSageMakerFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerFullAccess) policy attached\.

1. For **Projects**, see [SageMaker Studio Permissions Required to Use Projects](sagemaker-projects-studio-updates.md)\.

1. Under **Network and storage**, specify the following:
   + Your VPC information – For more information, see [Choose a VPC](onboard-vpc.md)\.
   + \(Optional\) **Storage encryption key** – SageMaker uses an AWS KMS key to encrypt your Amazon Elastic File System \(Amazon EFS\) and Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\) file systems\. By default, it uses an AWS managed key\. To use a customer managed key, enter its key ID or Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\)\. For more information, see [Protect Data at Rest Using Encryption](encryption-at-rest.md)\.

1. Choose **Submit**\.

   On the **Amazon SageMaker Studio Control Panel**, under **Studio Summary**, wait for **Status** to change to **Ready** and the **Add user** button to be enabled\.

   

1. Choose **Add user**\.

1. On the **Add user** page, keep the default name or create a new name\. A name can be up to 63 characters\. Valid characters: A\-Z, a\-z, 0\-9, and \- \(hyphen\)\. 

   For **Execution role**, choose an option from the role selector\.

1. Choose **Submit**\. The **Amazon SageMaker Studio Control Panel** opens with the new user listed\. The **Delete user** button and the **Open Studio** link are both enabled\.

1. To add more users, repeat steps 7 through 9\.

   When multiple users are listed, none of the users in the user list is chosen\. Choose a user and the **Delete user** button and the **Open Studio** link for that user are enabled\.

1. Choose **Open Studio**\. The **Amazon SageMaker Studio** loading page displays\.

   When SageMaker Studio opens, you can start using Studio\.

Now that you've onboarded to SageMaker Studio, use the following steps to subsequently access Studio\.

**Access Studio after you onboard**

1. Open the [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\.

1. Choose **Amazon SageMaker Studio** at the top left of the page\.

1. On the **Amazon SageMaker Studio Control Panel**, choose your user name and then choose **Open Studio**\.
