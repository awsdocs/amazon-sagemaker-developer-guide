# Step 2\.3\.1: Choose the Training Algorithm<a name="ex1-train-model-select-algorithm"></a>

To choose the right algorithm for your model, you typically follow an evaluation process\. For this exercise, you use the k\-means algorithm provided by Amazon SageMaker, so no evaluation is required\. For information about choosing algorithms, see [Use Amazon SageMaker Built\-in Algorithms ](algos.md)\.
