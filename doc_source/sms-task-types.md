# Built\-in Task Types<a name="sms-task-types"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth has numerous built\-in task types\. These built\-in task types streamline the process of creating image, text, video, and point cloud labeling jobs using the Amazon SageMaker console, API, associated language specific SDK's\.

For each task type, Ground Truth provides a worker task templates, and pre\- and post\-annotation lambda functions to process your input and output data respectively\. 

The following topics describe each built\-in task type, demo the worker UI provided by Ground Truth, and provide instructions to help you create a labeling job using that task type\.
