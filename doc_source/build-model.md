# Build Models<a name="build-model"></a>

To build machine learning models in Amazon SageMaker, you have the following options:
+ Use one of the built\-in algorithms\. Amazon SageMaker provides several built\-in machine learning algorithms that you can use for a variety of problem types\. For more information, see [Use Amazon SageMaker built\-in algorithms](algos.md)\.
+ Write a custom training script in a machine learning framework that Amazon SageMaker supports, and use one of the pre\-built framework containers to run it in Amazon SageMaker\. For information, see [Use Machine Learning Frameworks, Python, and R with Amazon SageMaker](frameworks.md)\.
+ Bring your own algorithm or model to train or host in Amazon SageMaker\. For information, see [Use Your Own Algorithms or Models with Amazon SageMaker ](your-algorithms.md)\.
+ Use an algorithm that you subscribe to from AWS Marketplace\. For information, see [Buy and Sell Amazon SageMaker Algorithms and Models in AWS Marketplace](sagemaker-marketplace.md)\.
