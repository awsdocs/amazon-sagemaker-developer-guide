# Add a Git Repository to Your Amazon SageMaker Account<a name="nbi-git-resource"></a>

To manage your GitHub repositories, easily associate them with your notebook instances, and associate credentials for repositories that require authentication, add the repositories as resources in your Amazon SageMaker account\. You can view a list of repositories that are stored in your account and details about each repository in the SageMaker console and by using the API\.

You can add Git repositories to your SageMaker account in the SageMaker console or by using the AWS CLI\.

**Note**  
You can use the SageMaker API [ â€¨`CreateCodeRepository`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCodeRepository.html) to add Git repositories to your SageMaker account, but step\-by\-step instructions are not provided here\.
