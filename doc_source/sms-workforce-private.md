# Use a Private Workforce<a name="sms-workforce-private"></a>

 A **private workforce** is a group of workers that *you* choose\. These can be employees of your company or a group of subject matter experts from your industry\. For example, if the task is to label medical images, you could create a private workforce of people knowledgeable about the images in question\. 

Each AWS account has access to a single private workforce per region, and the owner has the ability to create multiple **private** **work teams** within that workforce\. A single private work team is used to complete a labeling job or human review task, or a *job*\.  You can assign each work team to a separate job or use a single team for multiple jobs\. A single worker can be in more than one work team\.
