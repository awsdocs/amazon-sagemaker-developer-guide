# Get Started<a name="gs"></a>

In this section, you create your first Amazon SageMaker notebook instance, and train a model\. You train the model using an algorithm provided by Amazon SageMaker, deploy it, and validate it by sending inference requests to the model's endpoint\. 

You use this notebook instance for all of the exercises in this guide\. 

If you're new to Amazon SageMaker, we recommend that you read [How Amazon SageMaker Works](how-it-works.md) before creating your notebook instance\. For general information about notebook instances, see [Explore and Preprocess Data](how-it-works-notebooks-instances.md)\.
