# SageMaker Pipelines Overview<a name="pipelines-sdk"></a>

 An Amazon SageMaker Model Building Pipelines pipeline is a series of interconnected steps that is defined by a JSON pipeline definition\. This pipeline definition encodes a pipeline using a directed acyclic graph \(DAG\)\. This DAG gives information on the requirements for and relationships between each step of your pipeline\. The structure of a pipeline's DAG is determined by the data dependencies between steps\. These data dependencies are created when the properties of a step's output are passed as the input to another step\. The following image is an example of a pipeline DAG:

The following topics describe fundamental SageMaker Pipelines concepts\. For a tutorial describing the implementation of these concepts, see [Create and Manage SageMaker Pipelines](pipelines-build.md)\.
