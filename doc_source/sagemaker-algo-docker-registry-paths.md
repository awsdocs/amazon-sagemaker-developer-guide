# Docker Registry Paths and Example Code<a name="sagemaker-algo-docker-registry-paths"></a>

The following topics list the Docker registry path and other parameters for each of the Amazon SageMaker provided algorithms and Deep Learning Containers \(DLC\)\.

Use the path as follows:
+ To create a training job \([create\_training\_job](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/sagemaker.html#SageMaker.Client.create_training_job)\), specify the Docker registry path \(`TrainingImage`\) and the training input mode \(`TrainingInputMode`\) for the training image\. You create a training job to train a model using a specific dataset\.
+ To create a model \([create\_model](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/sagemaker.html#SageMaker.Client.create_model)\), specify the Docker registry path \(`Image`\) for the inference image \(`PrimaryContainer Image`\)\. SageMaker launches machine learning compute instances that are based on the endpoint configuration and deploys the model, which includes the artifacts \(the result of model training\)\.

**Note**  
For the registry path, use the `:1` version tag to ensure that you are using a stable version of the algorithm/DLC\. You can reliably host a model trained using an image with the `:1` tag on an inference image that has the `:1` tag\. Using the `:latest` tag in the registry path provides you with the most up\-to\-date version of the algorithm/DLC, but might cause problems with backward compatibility\. Avoid using the `:latest` tag for production purposes\.  
For XGBoost, do not use `:latest` or `:1`\. Use the specific version you require, such as `:0.90-1-cpu-py3`, `:0.90-2-cpu-py3`, `:1.0-1-cpu-py3`, or `:1.2-1`\.

To find the registry path, choose the AWS Region, then choose the algorithm or DLC\.
