For the **Training Image and Inference Image Registry Path** column, use the `:1` version tag to ensure that you are using a stable version of the algorithm\. You can reliably host a model trained using an image with the `:1` tag on an inference image that has the `:1` tag\. Using the `:latest` tag in the registry path provides you with the most up\-to\-date version of the algorithm, but might cause problems with backward compatibility\. Avoid using the `:latest` tag for production purposes\.

For the **Training Image and Inference Image Registry Path** column, depending on algorithm and region use one of the following values for *<ecr\_path>\.*

[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-algo-docker-registry-paths.html)

Use the paths and training input mode as follows:
+ To create a training job \(with a request to the [CreateTrainingJob](API_CreateTrainingJob.md) API\), specify the Docker Registry path and the training input mode for the training image\. You create a training job to train a model using a specific dataset\. 

  Â 
+ To create a model \(with a [CreateModel](API_CreateModel.md) request\), specify the Docker Registry path for the inference image\. Amazon SageMaker launches machine learning compute instances that are based on the endpoint configuration and deploys the model, which includes the artifacts \(the result of model training\)\.
