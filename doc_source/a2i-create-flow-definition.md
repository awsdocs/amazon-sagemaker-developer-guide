# Create a Flow Definition<a name="a2i-create-flow-definition"></a>

Use an Amazon Augmented AI \(Amazon A2I\) *human review workflow*, or *flow definition*, to specify the following:
+ For the Amazon Textract and Amazon Rekognition built\-in task types, the conditions under which your human loop will be called\.
+ The workforce that your tasks will be sent to\.
+ The instructions that your workforce will receive, which is called a *worker task template*\.
+ The configuration of your worker tasks, including the number of workers that receive a task and time limits to complete tasks\. 
+ Where your output data will be stored\. 

You can create a flow definition in the Amazon SageMaker console or using the Amazon SageMaker [ `CreateFlowDefinition`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateFlowDefinition.html) operation\. You can build a worker task template using the console for Amazon Textract and Amazon Rekognition task types while creating your flow definition\.

**Important**  
Human loop activation conditions, which trigger the human loop—for example, confidence thresholds—aren't available for Amazon A2I custom task types\. When using the console to create a flow definition for a custom task type, you can't specify activation conditions\. When using the Amazon A2I API to create a flow definition for a custom task type, you can't set the `HumanLoopActivationConditions` attribute of the `HumanLoopActivationConditionsConfig` parameter\. To control when human reviews are initiated, specify conditions under which `StartHumanLoop` is called in your custom application\. In this case, every `StartHumanLoop` invocation results in a human review\. For more information, see [Use Amazon Augmented AI with Custom Task Types](a2i-task-types-custom.md)\.

**Prerequisites**

To create a flow definition, you must have completed the prerequisites described in [Prerequisites](a2i-getting-started.md#a2i-getting-started-prerequisites)\. 

If you use the API to create a flow definition for any task type, or if you use a custom task type when creating a flow definition in the console, first you will need to create a worker task template\. For more information, see [Create a Worker UI](a2i-instructions-overview.md)\.

If you want to preview your worker task template while creating a flow definition for a built\-in task type in the console, ensure that you grant the role that you use to create the flow definition permission to access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your template artifacts using a policy like the one described in [Enable Worker Task Template Previews ](a2i-permissions-security.md#permissions-for-worker-task-templates-augmented-ai)\.

## Create a Flow Definition \(Console\)<a name="a2i-create-human-review-console"></a>

Use this procedure to create a Amazon Augmented AI \(Amazon A2I\) human review workflow using the Amazon SageMaker console\. If you are new to Amazon A2I, we recommend that you create a private work team using people in your organization, and use this work team's ARN when creating your flow definition\. To learn how to set up a private workforce and create a work team, see [Create a Private Workforce \(Console\)](sms-workforce-create-private-console.md)\. If you have already set up a private workforce, see [Create a Work Team Using the Amazon SageMaker Console](sms-workforce-management-private-console.md#create-workteam-sm-console) to learn how to add a work team to that workforce\.

If you are using Amazon A2I with one of the built\-in task types, you can create worker instructions using a default worker task template provided by Augmented AI while creating a human review workflow in the console\. To see samples of the default templates provided by Augmented AI, see the built\-in task types in [Use Task Types](a2i-task-types-general.md)\.

**To create flow definition \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon SageMaker console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, under the **Augmented AI** section, choose **Human review workflows** and then choose **Create human review workflow**\.

1. In **Overview**, do the following:

   1. For **Name**, enter a unique workflow name\. The name must be lowercase, unique within the AWS Region in your account, and can have up to 63 characters\. Valid characters include: a\-z, 0\-9, and \- \(hyphen\)\.

   1. For **S3 location for output**, enter the S3 bucket where you want to store the human review results\. The bucket must be located in the same AWS Region as the workflow\.

   1. For **IAM role**, choose the role that has the required permissions\. If you choose a built\-in task type and want to preview your worker template in the console, provide a role with the type of policy described in [Enable Worker Task Template Previews ](a2i-permissions-security.md#permissions-for-worker-task-templates-augmented-ai) attached\.

1. For **Task type**, choose the task type that you want the human worker to perform\. 

1. If you chose the Amazon Rekognition or Amazon Textract task type, specify the conditions that will invoke human review\.
   + For Amazon Rekognition image moderation tasks, choose an inference confidence score threshold interval that triggers human review\. 
   + For Amazon Textract tasks, you can trigger a human review when specific form keys are missing or when form key detection confidence is low\. You can also trigger a human review if, after evaluating all of the form keys in the text, confidence is lower than your required threshold for any form key\. You will see two variables that you can use to specify your confidence thresholds: **Identification confidence** and **Qualification confidence**\. To learn more about these variables, see [Use Amazon Augmented AI with Amazon Textract](a2i-textract-task-type.md)\.
   + For both task types, you can randomly send a percentage of data objects \(images or forms\) and their labels to humans for review\. 

1. Configure and specify your worker task template:

   1. If you are using the Amazon Rekognition or Amazon Textract task type:

      1. In the **Create template** section: 
        + To create instructions for your workers using the Amazon A2I default template for Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Textract task types, choose **Build from a default template**\.
          + If you choose **Build from a default template**, create your instructions under **Worker task design**: 
            + Provide a **Template name** that is unique in the AWS Region you are in\. 
            + In the **Instructions** section, provide detailed instructions on how to complete your task\. To help workers achieve greater accuracy, provide good and bad examples\. 
            + \(Optional\) In **Additional instructions**, provide your workers with additional information and instructions\. 

              For information on creating effective instructions, see [Creating Good Worker Instructions](a2i-creating-good-instructions-guide.md)\.
          + To select a custom template that you've created, choose it from the **Template** menu and provide a **Task description** to briefly describe the task for your workers\. To learn how to create a custom template, see [Create a Custom Worker Template \(Console\)](a2i-create-worker-template-console.md)\.

   1. If you are using the custom task type:

      1. In the **Worker task template** section, choose your template from the list\. All of the templates that you have created in the Amazon SageMaker console appear in this list\. To learn how to create a template for custom task types, see [Create a Worker UI](a2i-instructions-overview.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) Preview your worker template: 

   For Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Textract task types, you have the option to choose **See a sample worker task** to preview your worker task UI\.

   If you are creating a flow definition for a custom task type, you can preview your worker task UI using the `RenderUiTemplate` operation\. For more information, see [Preview a Worker Task Template](a2i-custom-templates.md#a2i-preview-your-custom-template)\.

1. For **Workers**, choose a workforce type\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

After you've created a human review workflow, it appears in the console under **Human review workflows**\. To see your flow definition's Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) and configuration details, choose the workflow by selecting its name\. 

If you are using a built\-in task type, you can use the flow definition ARN to start a human loop using that AWS service's API \(for example, the Amazon Textract API\)\. For custom task types, you can use the ARN to start a human loop using the Amazon Augmented AI Runtime API\. To learn more about both options, see [Create and Start a Human Loop](a2i-start-human-loop.md)\.

## Create a Flow Definition \(API\)<a name="a2i-create-human-review-api"></a>

To create a flow definition using the Amazon SageMaker API, you use the `CreateFlowDefinition` operation\. For an overview of the `CreateFlowDefinition` operation, and details about each parameter, see [ `CreateFlowDefinition`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateFlowDefinition.html)\. 

**To create a flow definition \(API\)**

1. For `FlowDeﬁnitionName`, enter a unique name\. The name must be unique within the AWS Region in your account, and can have up to 63 characters\. Valid characters include: a\-z, 0\-9, and \- \(hyphen\)\.

1. For `RoleArn`, enter the ARN of the role that you configured to grant access to your data sources\.

1. For `HumanLoopConfig`, enter information about the workers and what they should see\. For information about each parameter in `HumanLoopConfig`, see [HumanLoopConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateFlowDefinition.html#sagemaker-CreateFlowDefinition-request-HumanLoopActivationConfig)\.

1. \(Optional\) If you are using a built\-in task type, provide conditions that trigger a human loop in `HumanLoopActivationConﬁg`\. To learn how to create the input required for the `HumanLoopActivationConﬁg` parameter, see [JSON Schema for Human Loop Activation Conditions in Amazon Augmented AI](a2i-human-fallback-conditions-json-schema.md)\. If you do not specify conditions here, when you provide a flow definition to the AWS service associated with a built\-in task type \(for example, Amazon Textract or Amazon Rekognition\), that service will send every task to a human worker for review\. 

   If you are using a custom task type, `HumanLoopActivationConfig` is disabled\. To learn how to control when tasks are sent to human workers using a custom task type, see [Use Amazon Augmented AI with Custom Task Types](a2i-task-types-custom.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) If you are using a built\-in task type, specify the integration source \(for example, Amazon Rekognition or Amazon Textract\) in the [HumanLoopRequestSource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_HumanLoopRequestSource.html) parameter\.

1. For `OutputConfig`, indicate where in Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) to store the output of the human loop\.

1. \(Optional\) Use `Tags` to enter key value pairs to help you categorize and organize a flow definition\. Each tag consists of a key and a value, both of which you define\.

The following is an example of a request to create an Amazon Rekognition human loop using the AWS Python SDK \(Boto3\)\. Replace `'AWS/Rekognition/DetectModerationLabels/Image/V3'` with `'AWS/Textract/AnalyzeDocument/Forms/V1'` to create a Amazon Textract human loop\. For more information, see the [Boto 3 Augmented AI Runtime](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/sagemaker-a2i-runtime.html#AugmentedAIRuntime.Client.start_human_loop) documentation\.

```

    FlowDefinitionName='string',
    HumanLoopRequestSource={
         'AwsManagedHumanLoopRequestSource': 'AWS/Rekognition/DetectModerationLabels/Image/V3'
    },

                'TenthFractionsOfACent': 123
            }
        }
    },
    OutputConfig={
        'S3OutputPath': 'string',
        'KmsKeyId': 'string'
    },
    RoleArn='string',
    Tags=[
        {
            'Key': 'string',
            'Value': 'string'
        },
    ]
)
```

### Next Steps<a name="a2i-next-step-createflowdefinition-api"></a>

The return value of a successful call of the `CreateFlowDefinition` API operation is a flow definition Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\)\.

If you are using a built\-in task type, you can use the flow definition ARN to start a human loop using that AWS service's API \(i\.e\. the Amazon Textract API\)\. For custom task types, you can use the ARN to start a human loop using the Amazon Augmented AI Runtime API\. To learn more about both of these options, see [Create and Start a Human Loop](a2i-start-human-loop.md)\.
