# Models generated by Amazon SageMaker Autopilot<a name="autopilot-models"></a>

This procedure describes how to view details about Amazon SageMaker Autopilot jobs that you have run\. Details provided about the candidate models generated by Autopilot include:
+ A plot of the aggregated SHAP values that indicate the importance of each feature to help explain your models predictions\.
+ The summary statistics for various training and validation metrics, including the objective metric\.
+ A list of the hyperparameters used to train and tune the model\.

**Note**  
This topic assumes that you have already created and run an Autopilot experiment\. For information on how to create an Autopilot experiment, see [Create an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot experiment](autopilot-automate-model-development-create-experiment.md) 

**Note**  
To access the feature importance metrics in this procedure, you must first select File > Shut down, and then restart Studio from the Console\.

1. To view model details after running an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot job, select the triangular icon from the menu on the left to open the **Components and registries** page\.  
![\[Open the Components and registries page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/autopilot/autopilot-models-details-generated-1.PNG)

1. Select **Experiments and trials** from the dropdown menu\.  
![\[Open the Components and registries page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/autopilot/autopilot-models-details-generated-2.PNG)

1. Locate the Autopilot job whose details you want to examine in the **Unassigned trial components** list
