# Prerequisites to Using Augmented AI<a name="a2i-getting-started-prerequisites"></a>

Amazon A2I uses resources in IAM, SageMaker, and Amazon S3 to create and execute your human review workflows\. To use Amazon A2I, you need the following resources\. You can create some of these resources in the Amazon A2I console when you create a human review workflow\. To learn how, see [Demo: Get Started in the Amazon A2I Console](a2i-get-started-console.md)\.
+ One or more Amazon S3 buckets in the same AWS Region as the workflow for your input and output data\. To create a bucket, follow the instructions in [ Create a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide*\. 
+ An IAM role with required permissions to create a human review workflow and an IAM user or role with permission to access Augmented AI\. For more information, see [Permissions and Security in Amazon Augmented AIPermissions and Security](a2i-permissions-security.md)\.
+ A public, private, or vendor workforce for your human review workflows\. If you plan to use a private workforce, you need to set one up ahead of time in the same AWS Region as your Amazon A2I workflow\. To learn more about these workforce types, see [Create and Manage Workforces](sms-workforce-management.md)\.
**Important**  
Amazon maintains a list of AWS Services in scope for our various compliance efforts [here](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/)\. Amazon Augmented AI is not listed as in scope for compliance program assessments such as HIPAA, PCI, SOC, ISO, etc\. at this time\. If you use the Amazon Augmented AI service in conjunction with other AWS services such as Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Textract, please note that Amazon Augmented AI is not in scope with various compliance programs even if the other services are\. Your use of the Amazon Augmented AI service is part of the shared responsibility for your organization to determine the nature of the data\. You should determine if the service will process or store customer data and how it will or will not impact the compliance of your customer data environment\. We encourage you to discuss your workload objectives and goals with your AWS account team; they can assist you in evaluating your proposed use case and architecture, and how our security and compliance processes overlay that architecture\.
