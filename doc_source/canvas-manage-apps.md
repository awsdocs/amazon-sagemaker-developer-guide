# Manage apps<a name="canvas-manage-apps"></a>

The following sections describe how you can manage your SageMaker Canvas applications\. You can view, delete, or relaunch your apps from the **Control Panel** in the SageMaker console\.

## Check for active apps<a name="canvas-manage-apps-active"></a>

To check if you have any actively running SageMaker Canvas apps, use the following procedure\.

1. Open the [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Control panel**\.

1. Under **Users**, select the user profile name for the SageMaker Canvas app you want to view\.

1. Under **Apps**, find the app that says **Canvas** in the **App type** column\.

The **Status** column displays the status of the app, such as **Ready**, **Pending**, or **Deleted**\. If the app is **Ready**, then your SageMaker Canvas session is active\. You can delete the app from the console or log out from the SageMaker Canvas interface to stop the session\.

## Delete app<a name="canvas-manage-apps-delete"></a>

If you want to end your SageMaker Canvas session, you can either log out from the SageMaker Canvas application or delete your application from the SageMaker console\. A *session* is the period of time from when you start using SageMaker Canvas to the point when you stop using it\. Deleting the application only ends the session\. Models and datasets arenâ€™t affected, but Quick build tasks automatically restart when you log in again\. The billing for the session also stops\. 

Use the following procedure to delete your SageMaker Canvas application\.

1. Open the [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Control panel**\.

1. Under **Users**, select the user profile name for the SageMaker Canvas application you want to view\.

1. Under **Apps**, find the application that says **Canvas** in the **App type** column\.

1. In the **Action** column, choose **Delete app**\.

1. In the **Delete app** dialog box, select the **Yes, delete app** prompt, confirm the deletion by typing **delete**, and then choose **Delete**\.

After you've successfully deleted the application, the **Status** column says **Deleted**\. Otherwise, your application is still active\.

You can also end the session by [logging out](canvas-log-out.md) from within the SageMaker Canvas app\.

## Relaunch app<a name="canvas-manage-apps-relaunch"></a>

If you delete or log out of your SageMaker Canvas application and want to relaunch the application, use the following procedure\.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Control panel**\.

1. Under **Users**, select the user profile name for the SageMaker Canvas application you want to view\.

1. Choose **Launch app** and select **Canvas** from the dropdown list\.

SageMaker Canvas begins launching the app\.
