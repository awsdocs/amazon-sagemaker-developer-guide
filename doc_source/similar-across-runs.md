# SimilarAcrossRuns Rule<a name="similar-across-runs"></a>

This rule compares tensors gathered from a base trial with tensors from another trial\. 

This rule can be applied either to one of the supported deep learning frameworks \(TensorFlow, MXNet, and PyTorch\) or to the XGBoost algorithm\.

For an example of how to configure and deploy a built\-in rule, see [How to Use Built\-in Rules for Model Analysis](use-debugger-built-in-rules.md)\.


**Parameter Descriptions for the SimilarAcrossRuns Rule**  

| Parameter Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| base\_trial |  The trial run using this rule\. The rule inspects the tensors gathered from this trial\. **Required** Valid values: String  | 
| other\_trial |  The trial whose tensors you want to compare to those tensors gathered from the `base_trial`\. **Required** Valid values: String  | 
| collection\_names |  The list of collection names whose tensors the rule inspects\. **Optional** Valid values: List of strings or a comma\-separated string Default value: None  | 
| tensor\_regex |  A list of regex patterns used to restrict this comparison to specific scalar\-valued tensors\. The rule inspects only the tensors that match the regex patterns specified in the list\. If no patterns are passed, the rule compares all tensors gathered in the trials by default\. Only scalar\-valued tensors can be matched\. **Optional** Valid values: List of strings or a comma\-separated string  Default value: None  |
