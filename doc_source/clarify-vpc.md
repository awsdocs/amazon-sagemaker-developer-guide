# Give Amazon SageMaker Clarify Jobs Access to Resources in Your Amazon VPC<a name="clarify-vpc"></a>

To control access to your data and SageMaker Clarify jobs, we recommend that you create a private Amazon VPC and configure it so that your jobs aren't accessible over the public internet\. For information about creating and configuring an Amazon VPC for processing jobs, see [Give SageMaker Processing Jobs Access to Resources in Your Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/process-vpc)\. 

This document explains how to add additional Amazon VPC configurations that meet the requirements for SageMaker Clarify jobs\.

## Configure a SageMaker Clarify Job for Amazon VPC Access<a name="clarify-vpc-config"></a>

You need to specify subnets and security groups when configuring your private Amazon VPC for SageMaker Clarify jobs and to enable the job to get inferences from the SageMaker model when computing post\-training bias metrics and feature contributions that help explain model predictions\.

### SageMaker Clarify Job Amazon VPC Subnets and Security Groups<a name="clarify-vpc-job"></a>

Subnets and security groups in your private Amazon VPC can be assigned to a SageMaker Clarify job in various ways, depending on how you create the job\.
+ **SageMaker console**: Provide this information when you create the job in the **SageMaker Dashboard**\. From the **Processing** menu, choose **Processing jobs**, then choose **Create processing job**\. Select the **VPC** option in the **Network** panel and provide the subnets and security groups using the drop\-down lists\. Make sure network isolation option provided in this panel is turned off\.
+ **SageMaker API**: Use the `NetworkConfig.VpcConfig` request parameter of the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateProcessingJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateProcessingJob) API, as shown in the following example:

  ```
  "NetworkConfig": {
      "VpcConfig": {
          "Subnets": [
              "subnet-0123456789abcdef0",
              "subnet-0123456789abcdef1",
              "subnet-0123456789abcdef2"
          ],
          "SecurityGroupIds": [
              "sg-0123456789abcdef0"
          ]
      }
  }
  ```
+ **SageMaker Python SDK**: Use the `NetworkConfig` parameter of the [https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/processing.html?highlight=Processor#sagemaker.clarify.SageMakerClarifyProcessor](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/processing.html?highlight=Processor#sagemaker.clarify.SageMakerClarifyProcessor) API or [https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/processing.html?highlight=Processor#sagemaker.processing.Processor](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/processing.html?highlight=Processor#sagemaker.processing.Processor) API, as shown in the following example:

  ```
  from sagemaker.network import NetworkConfig
  network_config = NetworkConfig(
      subnets=[
          "subnet-0123456789abcdef0",
          "subnet-0123456789abcdef1",
          "subnet-0123456789abcdef2",
      ],
      security_group_ids=[
          "sg-0123456789abcdef0",
      ],
  )
  ```

SageMaker uses the information to create network interfaces and attach them to the SageMaker Clarify job\. The network interfaces provide a SageMaker Clarify job with a network connection within your Amazon VPC that is not connected to the public internet\. They also enable the SageMaker Clarify job to connect to resources in your private Amazon VPC\.

**Note**  
The network isolation option of the SageMaker Clarify job must be turned off \(by default the option is turned off\) so that the SageMaker Clarify job can communicate with the shadow endpoint\.

### Configure a Model Amazon VPC for Inference<a name="clarify-vpc-model"></a>

In order to compute post\-training bias metrics and explainability, the SageMaker Clarify job needs to get inferences from the SageMaker model that is specified by the `model_name` parameter of the [analysis configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-configure-processing-jobs.html#clarify-processing-job-configure-analysis) for the SageMaker Clarify processing job\. Alternatively, if you use the `SageMakerClarifyProcessor` API in the SageMaker Python SDK, the job needs to get the `model_name` specified by the [ModelConfig](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/processing.html?highlight=Processor#sagemaker.clarify.ModelConfig) class\. To accomplish this, the SageMaker Clarify job creates an ephemeral endpoint with the model, known as a *shadow endpoint*, and then applies the Amazon VPC configuration of the model to the shadow endpoint\.

To specify subnets and security groups in your private Amazon VPC to the SageMaker model, use the `VpcConfig` request parameter of the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateModel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateModel) API or provide this information when you create the model using the SageMaker dashboard in the console\. The following is an example of the `VpcConfig` parameter that you include in your call to `CreateModel`: 

```
"VpcConfig": {
    "Subnets": [
        "subnet-0123456789abcdef0",
        "subnet-0123456789abcdef1",
        "subnet-0123456789abcdef2"
    ],
    "SecurityGroupIds": [
        "sg-0123456789abcdef0"
    ]
}
```

You can specify the number of instances of the shadow endpoint to launch with the `initial_instance_count` parameter of the [analysis configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-configure-processing-jobs.html#clarify-processing-job-configure-analysis) for the SageMaker Clarify processing job\. Alternatively, if you use the `SageMakerClarifyProcessor` API in the SageMaker Python SDK, the job needs to get the `instance_count` specified by the [ModelConfig](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/processing.html?highlight=Processor#sagemaker.clarify.ModelConfig) class\.

**Note**  
Even if you only request one instance when creating the shadow endpoint, you need at least two subnets in the model's [ModelConfig](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/processing.html?highlight=Processor#sagemaker.clarify.ModelConfig) in distinct availability zones\. Otherwise the shadow endpoint creation fails with the following error:  
ClientError: Error hosting endpoint sagemaker\-clarify\-endpoint\-XXX: Failed\. Reason: Unable to locate at least 2 availability zone\(s\) with the requested instance type YYY that overlap with SageMaker subnets\.

If your model requires model files in Amazon S3, then the model Amazon VPC needs to have an Amazon S3 VPC endpoint\. For more information about creating and configuring an Amazon VPC for SageMaker models, see [Give SageMaker Hosted Endpoints Access to Resources in Your Amazon VPC](host-vpc.md)\. 

## Configure Your Private Amazon VPC for SageMaker Clarify jobs<a name="clarify-vpc-vpc"></a>

In general, you can follow the steps in [Configure Your Private VPC for SageMaker Processing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/process-vpc.html#process-vpc-vpc) to configure your private Amazon VPC for SageMaker Clarify jobs\. Here are some highlights and special requirements for SageMaker Clarify jobs\.

+ [Configure the Amazon VPC Security Group](#clarify-vpc-security-group)

### Connect to Resources Outside Your Amazon VPC<a name="clarify-vpc-nat"></a>

If you configure your Amazon VPC so that it does not have public internet access, then some additional setup is required to grant SageMaker Clarify jobs access to resources and services outside of your Amazon VPC\. For example, an Amazon S3 VPC endpoint is required because a SageMaker Clarify job needs to load a dataset from an S3 bucket as well as save the analysis results to an S3 bucket\. For more information, see [Create an Amazon S3 VPC Endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/process-vpc.html#process-vpc-s3) for the creation guide\. In addition, if a SageMaker Clarify job needs to get inferences from the shadow endpoint, then it needs to call several more AWS services\. 
+ **Create an Amazon SageMaker API service VPC endpoint**: The SageMaker Clarify job needs to call the Amazon SageMaker API service to manipulate the shadow endpoint, or to describe a SageMaker model for Amazon VPC validation\. You can follow the guidance provided in the [Securing all Amazon SageMaker API calls with AWS PrivateLink](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/securing-all-amazon-sagemaker-api-calls-with-aws-privatelink/) blog to create an Amazon SageMaker API VPC endpoint that allows the SageMaker Clarify job to make the service calls\. Note that the service name of Amazon SageMaker API service is `com.amazonaws.region.sagemaker.api`, where *region* is the name of the Region where your Amazon VPC resides\.
+ **Create an Amazon SageMaker Runtime VPC Endpoint**: The SageMaker Clarify job needs to call the Amazon SageMaker runtime service, which routes the invocations to the shadow endpoint\. The setup steps are similar to those for the Amazon SageMaker API service\. Note that the service name of Amazon SageMaker Runtime service is `com.amazonaws.region.sagemaker.runtime`, where *region* is the name of the Region where your Amazon VPC resides\.

### Configure the Amazon VPC Security Group<a name="clarify-vpc-security-group"></a>

SageMaker Clarify jobs support distributed processing when two or more processing instances are specified in one of the following ways:
+ **SageMaker console**: The **Instance count** is specified in the **Resource configuration** part of the **Job settings** panel on the **Create processing job** page\.
+ **SageMaker API**: The `InstanceCount` is specified when you create the job with the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateProcessingJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateProcessingJob) API\.
+ **SageMaker Python SDK**: The `instance_count` is specified when using the [SageMakerClarifyProcessor](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/processing.html?highlight=Processor#sagemaker.clarify.SageMakerClarifyProcessor) API or the [Processor](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/processing.html?highlight=Processor#sagemaker.processing.Processor) API\.

In distributed processing, you must allow communication between the different instances in the same processing job\. To do that, configure a rule for your security group that allows inbound connections between members of the same security group\. For information, see [Security group rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#SecurityGroupRules)\.
