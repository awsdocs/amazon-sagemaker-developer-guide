## Demand forecasting<a name="jumpstart-solutions-demand-forecasting"></a>

Demand forecasting uses historical time series data in order to make future estimations in relation to customer demand over a specific period and streamline the supply\-demand decision\-making process across businesses\. 

Demand forecasting use cases include predicting ticket sales in the transportation industry, stock prices, number of hospital visits, number of customer representatives to hire for multiple locations in the next month, product sales across multiple regions in the next quarter, cloud server usage for the next day for a video streaming service, electricity consumption for multiple regions over the next week, number of IoT devices and sensors such as energy consumption, and more\.

Time series data is categorized as *univariate* and *multi\-variate*\. For example, the total electricity consumption for a single household is a univariate time series over a period of time\. When multiple univariate time series are stacked on each other, it’s called a multi\-variate time series\. For example, the total electricity consumption of 10 different \(but correlated\) households in a single neighborhood make up a multi\-variate time series dataset\.

## Reinforcement learning<a name="jumpstart-solutions-reinforcement-learning"></a>

Reinforcement learning \(RL\) is a type of learning that is based on interaction with the environment\. This type of learning is used by an agent that must learn behavior through trial\-and\-error interactions with a dynamic environment in which the goal is to maximize the long\-term rewards that the agent receives as a result of its actions\. Rewards are maximized by trading off exploring actions that have uncertain rewards with exploiting actions that have known rewards\.

RL is well\-suited for solving large, complex problems, such as supply chain management, HVAC systems, industrial robotics, game artificial intelligence, dialog systems, and autonomous vehicles\.
