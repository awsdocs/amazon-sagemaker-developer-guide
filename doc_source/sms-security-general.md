# Ground Truth Security and Permissions<a name="sms-security-general"></a>

Use the topics on this page to learn about Ground Truth security features and how to configure AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) permissions to allow an IAM user or role to create a labeling job\. Additionally, learn how to create an *execution role*\. An execution role is the role that you specify when you create a labeling job\. This role is used to start your labeling job\.

If you are a new user and want to get started quickly, or if you do not require granular permissions, see [Use IAM Managed Policies with Ground Truth](sms-security-permissions-get-started.md)\.

For more information about IAM users and roles, see [Identities \(Users, Groups, and Roles\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) in the IAM User Guide\. 

To learn more about using IAM with SageMaker, see [Identity and Access Management for Amazon SageMaker](security-iam.md)\.
