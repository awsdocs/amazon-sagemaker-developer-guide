# Ground Truth Security and Permissions<a name="sms-security-general"></a>

Use the topics on this page to learn about Ground Truth security features and how to configure AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) permissions to allow a user or role to create a labeling job\. Additionally, learn how to create an *execution role*\. An execution role is the role that you specify when you create a labeling job\. This role is used to start your labeling job\.

If you are a new user and want to get started quickly, or if you do not require granular permissions, see [Use IAM Managed Policies with Ground Truth](sms-security-permissions-get-started.md)\.

For more information about IAM users and roles, see [Identities \(Users, Groups, and Roles\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) in the IAM User Guide\. 

To learn more about using IAM with SageMaker, see [Identity and Access Management for Amazon SageMaker](security-iam.md)\.
