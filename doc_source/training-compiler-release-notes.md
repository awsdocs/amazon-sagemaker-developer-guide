# Amazon SageMaker Training Compiler Release Notes<a name="training-compiler-release-notes"></a>

See the following release notes to track the latest updates for Amazon SageMaker Training Compiler\.

## SageMaker Training Compiler Release Notes: January 9, 2023<a name="training-compiler-release-notes-20230109"></a>

**Breaking Changes**
+ `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` points to a new optimizer in TensorFlow 2\.11\.0 and later\. The old optimizers are moved to `tf.keras.optimizers.legacy`\. You might encounter job failure due to the breaking change when you do the following\. 
  + Load checkpoints from an old optimizer\. We recommend you to switch to use the legacy optimizers\.
  + Use TensorFlow v1\. We recommend you to migrate to TensorFlow v2, or switch to the legacy optimizers if you need to continue using TensorFlow v1\.

  For more detailed list of breaking changes from the optimizer changes, see the [official TensorFlow v2\.11\.0 release notes](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.11.0) in the TensorFlow GitHub repository\.

## SageMaker Training Compiler Release Notes: December 8, 2022<a name="training-compiler-release-notes-20221208"></a>

**Bug Fixes**
+ Fixed the seed for PyTorch training jobs starting PyTorch v1\.12 to ensure that there is no discrepancy in model initialization across different processes\. See also [PyTorch Reproducibility](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html)\.
+ Fixed the issue causing PyTorch distributed training jobs on G4dn and G5 instances to not default to communication through [PCIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express)\.

**Known Issues**
+ Improper use of PyTorch/XLA APIs in Hugging Faceâ€™s vision transformers might lead to convergence issues\.

**Other Changes**
+ When using the Hugging Face Transformers `Trainer` class, make sure that you use SyncFree optimizers by setting the `optim` argument to `adamw_torch_xla`\. For more information, see [Large Language Models Using the Hugging Face Transformers `Trainer` Class](training-compiler-pytorch-models.md#training-compiler-pytorch-models-transformers-trainer)\. See also [Optimizer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.23.1/en/perf_train_gpu_one#optimizer) in the *Hugging Face Transformers documentation*\.
