# Step 1: Create an AWS Account<a name="gs-account"></a>

In this section, you sign up for an AWS account\. If you already have an AWS account, skip this step\.

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all AWS services, including Amazon SageMaker\. You are charged only for the services that you use\. 

**To create an AWS account**

1. Open [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/), and then choose **Create an AWS Account**\.
**Note**  
If you previously signed in to the AWS Management Console using AWS account root user credentials, choose **Sign in to a different account**\. If you previously signed in to the console using IAM credentials, choose **Sign\-in using root account credentials**\. Then choose **Create a new AWS account**\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code using the phone keypad\.

Write down your AWS account ID because you'll need it for the next task\.
