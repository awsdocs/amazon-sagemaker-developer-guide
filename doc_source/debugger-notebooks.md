# Debugger Example Notebooks<a name="debugger-notebooks"></a>

[SageMaker Debugger example notebooks](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-debugger/) are provided in the [aws/amazon\-sagemaker\-examples](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples) repository\. The Debugger example notebooks walk you through basic to advanced use cases of debugging and profiling training jobs\. 

We recommend that you run the example notebooks on SageMaker Studio or a SageMaker Notebook instance because most of the examples are designed for training jobs in the SageMaker ecosystem, including Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon SageMaker Python SDK\. 

To clone the example repository to SageMaker Studio, follow the instructions at [Amazon SageMaker Studio Tour](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-studio-end-to-end.html)\.

To find the examples in a SageMaker Notebook instance, follow the instructions at [SageMaker Notebook Instance Example Notebooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/howitworks-nbexamples.html)\.

**Important**  
To use the new Debugger features, you need to upgrade the SageMaker Python SDK and the `SMDebug` client library\. In your iPython kernel, Jupyter Notebook, or JupyterLab environment, run the following code to install the latest versions of the libraries and restart the kernel\.  

```
import sys
import IPython
!{sys.executable} -m pip install -U sagemaker smdebug
IPython.Application.instance().kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```
