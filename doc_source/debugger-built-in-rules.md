# List of Debugger Built\-in Rules<a name="debugger-built-in-rules"></a>

Use the Debugger built\-in rules provided by Amazon SageMaker Debugger and analyze tensors emitted while training your models\. The Debugger built\-in rules monitor various common conditions that are critical for the success of a training job\. You can call the built\-in rules using [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io) or the low\-level SageMaker API operations\. Depending on deep learning frameworks of your choice, there are four scopes of validity for the built\-in rules as shown in the following table\.

**Note**  
The maximum numbers of built\-in rules for a training job are 20 for `ProfilerRule` and 20 for `Rule`\. SageMaker Debugger fully manages the built\-in rules and analyzes your training job in parallel\. For more information about billing, see the **Amazon SageMaker Studio is available at no additional charge** section of the [Amazon SageMaker Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/) page\.

**Important**  
To use the new Debugger features, you need to upgrade the SageMaker Python SDK and the SMDebug client library\. In your iPython kernel, Jupyter notebook, or JupyterLab environment, run the following code to install the latest versions of the libraries and restart the kernel\.  

```
import sys
import IPython
!{sys.executable} -m pip install -U sagemaker smdebug
IPython.Application.instance().kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

from sagemaker.debugger import Rule, ProfilerRule, rule_configs

rules = [
    ProfilerRule.sagemaker(rule_configs.BuiltInRuleName_1()),
    ProfilerRule.sagemaker(rule_configs.BuiltInRuleName_2()),
    ...

```
from sagemaker.debugger import Rule, ProfilerRule, rule_configs

rules = [
    ProfilerRule.sagemaker(
        base_config=rule_configs.BuiltInRuleName(),
        rule_parameters={
                "key": "value"
        }
    )
    Rule.sagemaker(

        rule_parameters={
                "key": "value"
        }
        collections_to_save=[ 
            CollectionConfig(
                name="tensor_collection_name", 
                parameters={

## ProfilerReport<a name="profiler-report"></a>

The ProfilerReport rule invokes all of the built\-in rules for monitoring and profiling\. It creates a profiling report and updates when the individual rules are triggered\. You can download a comprehensive profiling report while a training job is running or after the training job is complete\. You can adjust the rule parameter values to customize sensitivity of the built\-in monitoring and profiling rules\. The following example code shows the basic format to adjust the built\-in rule parameters through the ProfilerReport rule\.

```
rules=[
    ProfilerRule.sagemaker(
        rule_configs.ProfilerReport(
            <BuiltInRuleName>_<parameter_name> = value
        )
    )  
]
```

If you trigger this ProfilerReport rule without any customized parameter as shown in the following example code, then the ProfilerReport rule triggers all of the built\-in rules for monitoring and profiling with their default parameter values\.

```
rules=[ProfilerRule.sagemaker(rule_configs.ProfilerReport())]
```

The following example code shows how to specify and adjust the CPUBottleneck rule's `cpu_threshold` parameter and the IOBottleneck rule's `threshold` parameter\.

```
rules=[
    ProfilerRule.sagemaker(
        rule_configs.ProfilerReport(
            CPUBottleneck_cpu_threshold = 90,
            IOBottleneck_threshold = 90
        )
    )  
]
```

## BatchSize<a name="batch-size-rule"></a>

The BatchSize rule helps detect if GPU is underutilized due to a small batch size\. To detect this issue, this rule monitors the average CPU utilization, GPU utilization, and GPU memory utilization\. If utilization on CPU, GPU, and GPU memory is low on average, it may indicate that the training job can either run on a smaller instance type or can run with a bigger batch size\. This analysis does not work for frameworks that heavily overallocate memory\. However, increasing the batch size can lead to processing or data loading bottlenecks because more data preprocessing time is required in each iteration\.

## PoorWeightInitialization<a name="poor-weight-initialization"></a>

 This rule detects if your model parameters have been poorly initialized\. 

Good initialization breaks the symmetry of the weights and gradients in a neural network and maintains commensurate activation variances across layers\. Otherwise, the neural network doesn't learn effectively\. Initializers like Xavier aim to keep variance constant across activations, which is especially relevant for training very deep neural nets\. Too small an initialization can lead to vanishing gradients\. Too large an initialization can lead to exploding gradients\. This rule checks the variance of activation inputs across layers, the distribution of gradients, and the loss convergence for the initial steps to determine if a neural network has been poorly initialized\.

| activation\_inputs\_regex |  A list of regex patterns used to restrict this comparison to specific scalar\-valued tensors\. The rule inspects only the tensors that match the regex patterns specified in the list\. If no patterns are passed, the rule compares all tensors gathered in the trials by default\. Only scalar\-valued tensors can be matched\. **Optional** Valid values: String Default value: `".*relu_input"`  | 
| threshold |  If the ratio between minimum and maximum variance of weights per layer exceeds the `threshold` at a step, the rule returns `True`\. **Optional** Valid values: Float Default value: `10.0`  | 
| distribution\_range |  If the minimum difference between 5th and 95th percentiles of the gradient distribution is less than the `distribution_range`, the rule returns `True`\. **Optional** Valid values: Float Default value: `0.001`  | 
| patience |  The number of steps to wait until the loss is considered to be no longer decreasing\. **Optional** Valid values: Integer Default value: `5`  | 
| steps |  The number of steps this rule analyzes\. You typically need to check only the first few iterations\. **Optional** Valid values: Float Default value: `10`  |

## SaturatedActivation<a name="saturated-activation"></a>

This rule detects if the tanh and sigmoid activation layers are becoming saturated\. An activation layer is saturated when the input of the layer is close to the maximum or minimum of the activation function\. The minimum and maximum of the tanh and sigmoid activation functions are defined by their respective `min_threshold` and `max_thresholds` values\. If the activity of a node drops below the `threshold_inactivity` percentage, it is considered saturated\. If more than a `threshold_layer` percent of the nodes are saturated, the rule returns `True`\.


**Parameter Descriptions for the SaturatedActivation Rule**

## WeightUpdateRatio<a name="weight-update-ratio"></a>

This rule keeps track of the ratio of updates to weights during training and detects if that ratio gets too large or too small\. If the ratio of updates to weights is larger than the `large_threshold value` or if this ratio is smaller than `small_threshold`, the rule returns `True`\.

Conditions for training are best when the updates are commensurate to gradients\. Excessively large updates can push the weights away from optimal values, and very small updates result in very slow convergence\. This rule requires weights to be available for two training steps, and `train.save_interval` needs to be set equal to `num_steps`\.


**Parameter Descriptions for the WeightUpdateRatio Rule**  

| Parameter Name, | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| base\_trial |  The base trial training job name\. This parameter is automatically set to the current training job by Amazon SageMaker Debugger\.  **Required** Valid values: String  | 
| num\_steps |  The number of steps across which the rule checks to determine if the tensor has changed\.  The number of steps across which you want to compare the weight ratios\. If you pass no value, the rule runs by default against the current step and the immediately previous saved step\. If you override the default by passing a value for this parameter, the comparison is done between weights at step `s` and at a step `>= s - num_steps`\. **Optional** Valid values: Integer Default value: `None`  | 
| large\_threshold |  The maximum value that the ratio of updates to weight can take before the rule returns `True`\.  **Optional** Valid values: Float Default value: `10.0`  | 
| small\_threshold |  The minimum value that the ratio of updates to weight can take, below which the rule returns `True`\. **Optional** Valid values: Float Default value: `0.00000001`  | 
| epsilon |  A small constant used to ensure that Debugger does not divide by zero when computing the ratio updates to weigh\. **Optional** Valid values: Float Default value: `0.000000001`  |

## ClassImbalance<a name="class-imbalance"></a>

This rule measures sampling imbalances between classes and throws errors if the imbalance exceeds a threshold or if too many mispredictions for underrepresented classes occur as a result of the imbalance\.

Classification models require well\-balanced classes in the training dataset or a proper weighting/sampling of classes during training\. The rule performs the following checks:
+  It counts the occurrences per class\. If the ratio of number of samples between smallest and largest class is larger than the `threshold_imbalance`, an error is thrown\.
+  It checks the prediction accuracy per class\. If resampling or weighting has not been correctly applied, then the model can reach high accuracy for the class with many training samples, but low accuracy for the classes with few training samples\. If a fraction of mispredictions for a certain class is above `threshold_misprediction`, an error is thrown\.

This rule can be applied either to one of the supported deep learning frameworks \(TensorFlow, MXNet, and PyTorch\) or to the XGBoost algorithm\.

For an example of how to configure and deploy a built\-in rule, see [Configure Debugger Built\-in Rules](use-debugger-built-in-rules.md)\.

| samples |  The number of labels that have to be processed before an imbalance is evaluated\. The rule might not be triggered until it has seen sufficient samples across several steps\. The more classes that your dataset contains, the larger this `sample` number should be\.  **Optional** Valid values: Integer Default value: `500` \(assuming a dataset like MNIST with 10 classes\)  | 
| argmax |  If `True`, [np\.argmax]( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.9.3/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html) is applied to the prediction tensor\. Required when you have a vector of probabilities for each class\. It is used to determine which class has the highest probability\. **Conditional** Valid values: Boolean Default value: `False`  |

## LossNotDecreasing<a name="loss-not-decreasing"></a>

This rule can be applied either to one of the supported deep learning frameworks \(TensorFlow, MXNet, and PyTorch\) or to the XGBoost algorithm\. You must specify either the `collection_names` or `tensor_regex` parameter\. If both the parameters are specified, the rule inspects the union of tensors from both sets\.

The rule inspects only the tensors that match the regex patterns specified in the list\. If no patterns are passed, the rule compares all tensors gathered in the trials by default\. Only scalar\-valued tensors can be matched\. **Optional** Valid values: List of strings or a comma\-separated string  Default value: `None`  |

## Overtraining<a name="overtraining"></a>

This rule detects if a model is being overtrained\. After a number of training iterations on a well\-behaved model \(both training and validation loss decrease\), the model approaches to a minimum of the loss function and does not improve anymore\. If the model continues training it can happen that validation loss starts increasing, because the model starts overfitting\. This rule sets up thresholds and conditions to determine if the model is not improving, and prevents overfitting problems due to overtraining\.

This rule can be applied either to one of the supported deep learning frameworks \(TensorFlow, MXNet, and PyTorch\) or to the XGBoost algorithm\.

## StalledTrainingRule<a name="stalled-training"></a>

StalledTrainingRule detects if there is no progress made on training job, and stops the training job if the rule fires\. This rule requires tensors to be periodically saved in a time interval defined by its `threshold` parameter\. This rule keeps on monitoring for new tensors, and if no new tensor has been emitted for threshold interval rule gets fired\. 


**Parameter Descriptions for the StalledTrainingRule Rule**  

| Parameter Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| base\_trial |  The base trial training job name\. This parameter is automatically set to the current training job by Amazon SageMaker Debugger\.  **Required** Valid values: String  | 
| threshold |  A threshold that defines by how much time in seconds the rule waits for a tensor output until it fires a stalled training issue\. Default value is 1800 seconds\. **Optional** Valid values: Integer Default value: `1800`  | 
| stop\_training\_on\_fire |  If set to `True`, watches if the base training job outputs tensors in "`threshold`" seconds\. **Optional** Valid values: Boolean Default value: `False`  | 
| training\_job\_name\_prefix |  The prefix of base training job name\. If `stop_training_on_fire` is true, the rule searches for SageMaker training jobs with this prefix in the same account\. If there is an inactivity found, the rule takes a `StopTrainingJob` action\. Note if there are multiple jobs found with same prefix, the rule skips termination\. It is important that the prefix is set unique per each training job\. **Optional** Valid values: String  |

## TensorVariance<a name="tensor-variance"></a>

This rule detects if you have tensors with very high or low variances\. Very high or low variances in a tensor could lead to neuron saturation, which reduces the learning ability of the neural network\. Very high variance in tensors can also eventually lead to exploding tensors\. Use this rule to detect such issues early\.

This rule can be applied either to one of the supported deep learning frameworks \(TensorFlow, MXNet, and PyTorch\) or to the XGBoost algorithm\. You must specify either the `collection_names` or `tensor_regex` parameter\. If both the parameters are specified, the rule inspects the union of tensors from both sets\.

For an example of how to configure and deploy a built\-in rule, see [Configure Debugger Built\-in Rules](use-debugger-built-in-rules.md)\.


**Parameter Descriptions for the TensorVariance Rule**  

| Parameter Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| base\_trial |  The base trial training job name\. This parameter is automatically set to the current training job by Amazon SageMaker Debugger\.  **Required** Valid values: String  | 
| collection\_names |  The list of collection names whose tensors the rule inspects\. **Optional** Valid values: List of strings or a comma\-separated string Default value: None  | 
| tensor\_regex |  A list of regex patterns used to restrict this comparison to specific scalar\-valued tensors\. The rule inspects only the tensors that match the regex patterns specified in the list\. If no patterns are passed, the rule compares all tensors gathered in the trials by default\. Only scalar\-valued tensors can be matched\. **Optional** Valid values: List of strings or a comma\-separated string  Default value: None  | 
| max\_threshold |  The threshold for the upper bound of tensor variance\. **Optional** Valid values: Float Default value: None  | 
| min\_threshold |  The threshold for the lower bound of tensor variance\. **Optional** Valid values: Float Default value: None  |

## UnchangedTensor<a name="unchanged-tensor"></a>

This rule detects whether a tensor is no longer changing across steps\. 

This rule runs the [numpy\.allclose]( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.allclose.html) method to check if the tensor isn't changing\.

This rule can be applied either to one of the supported deep learning frameworks \(TensorFlow, MXNet, and PyTorch\) or to the XGBoost algorithm\. You must specify either the `collection_names` or `tensor_regex` parameter\. If both the parameters are specified, the rule inspects the union of tensors from both sets\.

## NLPSequenceRatio<a name="nlp-sequence-ratio"></a>

This rule calculates the ratio of specific tokens given the rest of the input sequence that is useful for optimizing performance\. For example, you can calculate the percentage of padding end\-of\-sentence \(EOS\) tokens in your input sequence\.

If the number of unknown words is too high, an alternate vocabulary could be used\.

This rule is applicable to deep learning applications\.

## Confusion<a name="confusion"></a>

This rule evaluates the goodness of a confusion matrix for a classification problem\.

It creates a matrix of size `category_no*category_no` and populates it with data coming from \(`labels`, `predictions`\) pairs\. For each \(`labels`, `predictions`\) pair, the count in `confusion[labels][predictions]` is incremented by 1\. When the matrix is fully populated, the ratio of data on\-diagonal values and off\-diagonal values are evaluated as follows:
+ For elements on the diagonal: `confusion[i][i]/sum_j(confusion[j][j])>=min_diag`
+ For elements off the diagonal: `confusion[j][i])/sum_j(confusion[j][i])<=max_off_diag`

This rule can be applied to the XGBoost algorithm\.
