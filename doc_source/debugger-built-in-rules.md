# List of Built\-in Rules Provided by Amazon SageMaker Debugger<a name="debugger-built-in-rules"></a>

Use the built\-in rules provided by Amazon SageMaker Debugger to analyze tensors emitted during the training of machine learning models\. These rules monitor various common conditions that are critical for the success of a training job\. There are four scopes of validity for the built\-in rules\.


**Scopes of Validity for Build\-in Rules**  

| Scope of Validity | Built\-in Rules |
