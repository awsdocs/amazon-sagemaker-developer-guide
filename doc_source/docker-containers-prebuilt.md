# Use Prebuilt SageMaker Docker images<a name="docker-containers-prebuilt"></a>

Amazon SageMaker provides containers for its built\-in algorithms and prebuilt Docker images for some of the most common machine learning frameworks, such as Apache MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Chainer\. It also supports machine learning libraries such as scikit\-learn and SparkML\. 

You can use these images from your SageMaker notebook instance or SageMaker Studio\. You can also extend the prebuilt SageMaker images to include libraries and needed functionality\. The following topics give information about the available images and how to use them\.

**Note**  
For information on Docker images for developing reinforcement learning \(RL\) solutions in SageMaker, see [SageMaker RL Containers](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-rl-container)\.
