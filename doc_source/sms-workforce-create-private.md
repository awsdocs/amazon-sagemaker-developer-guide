# Create a Private Workforce<a name="sms-workforce-create-private"></a>

 There are three ways that you can create a private workforce:
+ Create a new workforce while you are creating your labeling job\. Do this in the Amazon SageMaker console in the Ground Truth section\. 
+ Create a new workforce before you create your labeling job\. Do this in the Amazon SageMaker console in the Ground Truth section\. 
+ Import an existing workforce after creating a user pool in the Amazon Cognito console\. 

Once you create a private workforce, that workforce and all work teams and workers associated with it will be available to to use for all Ground Truth labeling job tasks and Amazon Augmented AI human review workflows tasks\. If you are new to Amazon SageMaker and want to test Ground Truth or Amazon A2I, we suggest that you create a private work team consisting of people from your organization using the console\. Use this work team when creating labeling or human review workflows \(flow definitions\) to test your worker UI and job\-workflow\.
