# Use Apache MXNet with Amazon SageMaker<a name="mxnet"></a>

You can use SageMaker to train and deploy a model using custom MXNet code\. The [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io) MXNet estimators and models and the SageMaker open\-source MXNet container make writing a MXNet script and running it in SageMaker easier\.

## What do you want to do?<a name="mxnet-intent"></a>

I want to train a custom MXNet model in SageMaker\.  
For a sample Jupyter notebook, see the [MXNet example notebooks](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/mxnet_mnist) in the Amazon SageMaker Examples GitHub repository\.  
For documentation, see [Train a Model with MXNet](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_mxnet.html#train-a-model-with-mxnet)\.

I have an MXNet model that I trained in SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a hosted endpoint\.  
For more information, see [Deploy MXNet models](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_mxnet.html#deploy-mxnet-models)\.

I have an MXNet model that I trained outside of SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a SageMaker endpoint  
For more information, see [Deploy Endpoints from Model Data](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_mxnet.html#deploy-endpoints-from-model-data)\.

I want to see the API documentation for [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io) MXNet classes\.  
For more information, see [MXNet Classes](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/mxnet/sagemaker.mxnet.html)\. 

I want to find the SageMaker MXNet container repository\.  
For more information, see [SageMaker MXNet Container GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-mxnet-container)\.

I want to find information about MXNet versions supported by AWS Deep Learning Containers\.  
For more information, see [Available Deep Learning Container Images](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md)\.

 For general information about writing MXNet script mode training scripts and using MXNet script mode estimators and models with SageMaker, see [Using MXNet with the SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_mxnet.html)\.
