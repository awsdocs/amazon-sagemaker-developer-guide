# Use Apache MXNet with Amazon SageMaker<a name="mxnet"></a>

You can use Amazon SageMaker to train and deploy a model using custom MXNet code\. The Amazon SageMaker Python SDK MXNet estimators and models and the Amazon SageMaker open\-source MXNet container make writing a MXNet script and running it in Amazon SageMaker easier\.

What do you want to do?

I want to train a custom MXNet model in Amazon SageMaker\.  
For a sample Jupyter notebook, see [https://github\.com/awslabs/amazon\-sagemaker\-examples/tree/master/sagemaker\-python\-sdk/mxnet\_mnist](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/mxnet_mnist)\.  
For documentation, see [Train a Model with MXNet](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_mxnet.html#train-a-model-with-mxnet)\.

I have an MXNet model that I trained in Amazon SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a hosted endpoint\.  
[Deploy MXNet models](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_mxnet.html#deploy-mxnet-models)\.

I have an MXNet model that I trained outside of Amazon SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to an Amazon SageMaker endpoint  
[Deploy Endpoints from Model Data](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_mxnet.html#deploy-endpoints-from-model-data)\.

I want to see the API documentation for Amazon SageMaker Python SDK MXNet classes\.  
[MXNet Classes](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sagemaker.mxnet.html)

I want to see information about Amazon SageMaker MXNet containers\.  
[https://github\.com/aws/sagemaker\-mxnet\-container](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-mxnet-container)\.

 For general information about writing MXNet script mode training scripts and using MXNet script mode estimators and models with Amazon SageMaker, see [Using MXNet with the SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_mxnet.html)\.

For information about MXNet versions supported by the Amazon SageMaker MXNet container, see [https://github\.com/aws/sagemaker\-python\-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/mxnet/README\.rst](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/mxnet/README.rst)\.
