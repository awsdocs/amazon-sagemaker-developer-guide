Amazon SageMaker supports the following machine learning environments\.
+ *Amazon SageMaker Studio*: Lets you build, train, debug, deploy, and monitor your machine learning models\.
+ *RStudio on Amazon SageMaker*: RStudio is an IDE for [R](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/getting-started-with-r-on-amazon-web-services/), with a console, syntax\-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management\.
+ *Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab*: Studio Lab is a free service that gives you access to AWS compute resources, in an environment based on open\-source JupyterLab, without requiring an AWS account\.
+ *Amazon SageMaker Canvas*: Gives you the ability to use machine learning to generate predictions without needing to code\.
+ *Amazon SageMaker geospatial*: Gives you the ability to build, train, and deploy geospatial models\.

To use these machine learning environments, except Studio Lab, you or your organization's administrator must create an Amazon SageMaker Domain\. Studio Lab has a separate onboarding process\.
